        "html": "<p><a class=\"h-card\" href=\"https://blog.avas.space/\">Ava</a> started a <a href=\"https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/\">Bear Blog question challenge</a> this month and Kev <a href=\"https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge\">adapted them</a> to be a bit more generic. Several indieweb pals have <a href=\"https://artlung.com/blog/2025/01/16/blog-questions-challenge/\">posted</a> <a href=\"https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2025/01/blog-tag-game/\">their</a> <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/15/blog-questions-challenge/\">responses</a>. I miss these kind of meta posts, so here are my responses:</p>\n\n<p><b>1. Why did you start blogging in the first place?</b></p>\n\n<p>I don’t remember the <em>exact</em> inspiration, but it was probably when I came across <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)\">Blogger</a> or maybe it was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanga\">Xanga</a> blog. I had been tinkering with my GeoCities site since the late 90s, but that was more of a general collection of pages than a “weblog.”</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, I decided to get this domain in part because I was coming around to the “gRegorLove” nickname that my friend Phil had given me. I thought it would be funny to set up a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030111095328/http://www.gregorlove.com/g-love.php?pg=apply\">wife application</a> (archived) on my own site. I also wanted to experiment with things like Blogger. I remember thinking it was <em>so cool</em> to be able to publish posts by FTP.</p>\n\n<p>Sometime in 2000 I started posting more blog-type posts. It seemed so novel and was cool to be able to share text like that in my little corner of the web.</p>\n\n<p><b>2. What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?</b></p>\n\n<p>I have been using the <a href=\"https://processwire.com/\">ProcessWire</a> CMS/framework for almost ten years now. Before that I used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_CMS\">Nucleus CMS</a> for a long time. And before <em>that</em> I briefly experimented with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B2evolution\">B2evolution</a> and Blogger.</p>\n\n<p>I switched to ProcessWire because official development on Nucleus had stopped, unfortunately. I really enjoyed Nucleus’ extensibility and I made some of my first open source contributions there, but I wasn’t in a place to take on being one of the few remaining contributors.</p>\n\n<p>I had used ProcessWire professionally for several sites and I really enjoyed its flexibility for building any type of site, not just a blog system that could be hacked into other types of things. ProcessWire is built entirely on custom fields and custom templates, so it allows a lot of creativity and not just a timeline of reverse chronological posts.</p>\n\n<p><b>3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?</b></p>\n\n<p>I posted on Xanga for quite a while. I think most of those posts still exist on my site, though. The phrase “Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere” (<a href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">POSSE</a>) didn’t exist then, but I definitely had the desire to keep the original posts on my site and cross-post them.</p>\n\n<p><b>4. How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?</b></p>\n\n<p>Half the time I will write in the ProcessWire editor (like now). The other half of the time I will use Sublime Text or Obsidian. I have used <a href=\"https://writemonkey.com/\">Writemonkey</a> in the past because I enjoyed the ability to type in full-screen with no distractions. It has optional typewriter sound effects, too, which was fun. I think my use of that mostly dropped off because ProcessWire has a decent visual editor.</p>\n\n<p><b>5. When do you feel most inspired to write?</b></p>\n\n<p>Whenever I see that the last post was a month or two ago? ????

        "text": "Ava started a Bear Blog question challenge this month and Kev adapted them to be a bit more generic. Several indieweb pals have posted their responses. I miss these kind of meta posts, so here are my responses:\n\n1. Why did you start blogging in the first place?\n\nI don’t remember the exact inspiration, but it was probably when I came across Blogger or maybe it was a Xanga blog. I had been tinkering with my GeoCities site since the late 90s, but that was more of a general collection of pages than a “weblog.”\n\nIn 1999, I decided to get this domain in part because I was coming around to the “gRegorLove” nickname that my friend Phil had given me. I thought it would be funny to set up a wife application (archived) on my own site. I also wanted to experiment with things like Blogger. I remember thinking it was so cool to be able to publish posts by FTP.\n\nSometime in 2000 I started posting more blog-type posts. It seemed so novel and was cool to be able to share text like that in my little corner of the web.\n\n2. What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?\n\nI have been using the ProcessWire CMS/framework for almost ten years now. Before that I used Nucleus CMS for a long time. And before that I briefly experimented with B2evolution and Blogger.\n\nI switched to ProcessWire because official development on Nucleus had stopped, unfortunately. I really enjoyed Nucleus’ extensibility and I made some of my first open source contributions there, but I wasn’t in a place to take on being one of the few remaining contributors.\n\nI had used ProcessWire professionally for several sites and I really enjoyed its flexibility for building any type of site, not just a blog system that could be hacked into other types of things. ProcessWire is built entirely on custom fields and custom templates, so it allows a lot of creativity and not just a timeline of reverse chronological posts.\n\n3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?\n\nI posted on Xanga for quite a while. I think most of those posts still exist on my site, though. The phrase “Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere” (POSSE) didn’t exist then, but I definitely had the desire to keep the original posts on my site and cross-post them.\n\n4. How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?\n\nHalf the time I will write in the ProcessWire editor (like now). The other half of the time I will use Sublime Text or Obsidian. I have used Writemonkey in the past because I enjoyed the ability to type in full-screen with no distractions. It has optional typewriter sound effects, too, which was fun. I think my use of that mostly dropped off because ProcessWire has a decent visual editor.\n\n5. When do you feel most inspired to write?\n\nWhenever I see that the last post was a month or two ago? ???? Though seriously, I updated my homepage to show the full content of the latest article for the first 45 days. After that, it changes to just the title + link under the “Other Recent Articles” heading. That can serve as a little visual nudge for me to write something if I notice that.\n\nInspirations vary. Sometimes I want to document everyday things for myself to look back on. Sometimes I want to put together various bits of information in one space and (hopefully) make it easier to digest, e.g. with some of my posts about health and safety. Sometimes I just want to vent.\n\n6. Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?\n\nMost posts I am pretty casual about. I might let a draft sit overnight and re-read it to tweak some phrasing. My longer or more important (to me) posts will definitely be drafted and re-written over time, like “Four Years of Blank”.\n\n7. What’s your favorite post on your blog?\n\nOof, this question is unfair. You saw that I’ve been posting for almost 25 years, right? ????I think I might have to stretch the rules on this one and give some favorites in entirely arbitrary categories.\n\nFavorite look back/in-the-feels: “Ten Years On”\n\tFavorite short fiction: “Drabble: A Paradox”\n\tFavorite visual creative stuff: “Don’t Multitask with Fire”\n\tFavorite weird: “Top Five Worst Ways to Refer to Human Hair”\n8. Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?\n\nI have thought several times that I should bring back and modernize the wife application. That was some good silly fun.\n\nI have been pretty pleased with the design I’ve had since 2011. It’s definitely the longest period I’ve gone without a full redesign. I have added a lot of different types of posts since then, so the navigation probably needs some updates. I have made updates to the homepage to try to highlight some of those, like photos and notes.

I need to ask Al about that.\n\nBonus round: tag/nudge some other people to fill this out\n\nThis is my little addition to the prompts. If you blog, I’d love to read your responses as well. If you don’t, maybe this is a good time to start!\n\nI’d like to nudge: Sheryl, Isha, Rachelskirts, and Tyler."

Create an empty volume, mount it, fill the volume up with thousands of tiny files (I have a Python script that does a nice job of this), delete a subset of them, see how much space you have free, copy one or more audio files to fill the free space, delete more tiny files, fill the space up with audio files, etc. Then when you're done, dismount the volume and open the image in an audio editor. It helps if the filler audio files you're using have the same parameters as how you open the raw volume image. What you'll find, after the FATs and such, is disorganized chaos, as the operating system has no choice but to put random bits and pieces of the audio files wherever it can.

Why did you make this blog in the first place?</h2>\n<a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tracy-durnell-dot-com-portfolio.jpg\"><img src=\"https://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tracy-durnell-dot-com-portfolio-300x247.jpg\" alt=\"screengrab of website with art nouveau styling -- a digital painting of a woman surrounded by waving rose vines -- and several images showing project work of a graphic design portfolio\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" /></a>No one else’s website looked like it, but it was too much of a pain to update and the only way to use the nav on mobile was zooming in and out because the leaves were an image map so also it wasn’t accessible<p>My domain had sat stagnant as a hand-coded HTML site for many years as I had it in my head that I needed to design websites from scratch, and I was burned out on web design. <strong>It became one of those lingering <a href=\"https://cascadiainspired.com/should-wrong-foundation/\"><em>shoulds</em></a> in the back of my mind</strong>, haunting me, but I felt obligated to have a portfolio website. Then Google started to nag and downrank me because my site wasn’t mobile friendly/ responsive, so it had just become this massive drag ????</p>\n<p>Then I <a href=\"https://cascadiainspired.com/excited-about-the-indie-web/\">encountered the idea of digital gardens</a> and was enchanted. <strong>I wanted a blog where I didn’t feel constrained by topics</strong> — my previous blog <a href=\"https://cascadiainspired.com/\">Cascadia Inspired</a> was quite thematic, to the point I didn’t even post pictures from trips I’d taken to the Southwest because it was PNW-focused — and <strong>where I felt less self-imposed pressure about the quality of what I posted</strong>. I decided I wasn’t going to be freelancing any time soon (famous last words lol) so I could do without a portfolio site. Almost as soon as I <a href=\"https://cascadiainspired.com/farewell-portfolio-hello-mind-garden/\">took down the portfolio site</a> and set up the new blog format, <a href=\"https://cascadiainspired.com/thinking-better-with-my-mind-garden/\">I adored it</a>.</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2>2. Why did you choose WordPress?</h2>\n<p>I researched some options for <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/digital_garden\">setting up a digital garden</a> and couldn’t figure out why I needed anything special when I could use WordPress with self-pingbacks. (Since then I’ve recognized some gaps, but I’m still fine with it for now, especially since the site’s become more <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book\">commonplace book</a> than garden.)</p>\n<h2>3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?</h2>\n<p>In college I blogged on Blogger. I put together a little <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/timeline/\">timeline of my past blogs</a> ????</p>\n<h2>4. How do you write your posts?</h2>\n<p>I write directly in the editor in browser, and it is a truly egregiously bad practice that I’m hoping to improve this year ???? I tested out blogging in Scrivener last year, but it felt like overkill.</p>\n<p>Recently I’ve been doing a bit of editing in Google Docs and Word; <strong>the challenge is formatting</strong>. I <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/01/how-i-edited-my-blog-post-accepting-friction/\">collect a bunch of links and notes</a> in a draft post, often add in some loose headers for structure, then copy and paste into the word processor. Annoyingly, block quotes and headings get lost when pasted back into WordPress. I only just realized last week that if I start from text view, then all the code gets brought into the word processor — it looks ugly and can be hard to parse while I’m working in it, but at least it preserves the formatting ????‍♀️ This isn’t ideal but probably better than writing only in-browser? TBD.</p>\n<p>I do incorporate <strong>previewing</strong> my writing often while editing in browser, and the word processor doesn’t allow that. (When previewing, I check for things like paragraphs that are too long or blocks of text that could benefit from more headings or bolded text for skimmability; I tend to write long so I want people to be able to figure out if they’re interested easily.)</p>\n<h2>5.

        "text": "Reilly shared this blog tag game and Dom tagged me so I’ll join in!\n1. Why did you make this blog in the first place?\nNo one else’s website looked like it, but it was too much of a pain to update and the only way to use the nav on mobile was zooming in and out because the leaves were an image map so also it wasn’t accessibleMy domain had sat stagnant as a hand-coded HTML site for many years as I had it in my head that I needed to design websites from scratch, and I was burned out on web design. It became one of those lingering shoulds in the back of my mind, haunting me, but I felt obligated to have a portfolio website. Then Google started to nag and downrank me because my site wasn’t mobile friendly/ responsive, so it had just become this massive drag ????\nThen I encountered the idea of digital gardens and was enchanted. I wanted a blog where I didn’t feel constrained by topics — my previous blog Cascadia Inspired was quite thematic, to the point I didn’t even post pictures from trips I’d taken to the Southwest because it was PNW-focused — and where I felt less self-imposed pressure about the quality of what I posted. I decided I wasn’t going to be freelancing any time soon (famous last words lol) so I could do without a portfolio site. Almost as soon as I took down the portfolio site and set up the new blog format, I adored it.\n\n2. Why did you choose WordPress?\nI researched some options for setting up a digital garden and couldn’t figure out why I needed anything special when I could use WordPress with self-pingbacks. (Since then I’ve recognized some gaps, but I’m still fine with it for now, especially since the site’s become more commonplace book than garden.)\n3. Have you blogged on other platforms before?\nIn college I blogged on Blogger. I put together a little timeline of my past blogs ????\n4. How do you write your posts?\nI write directly in the editor in browser, and it is a truly egregiously bad practice that I’m hoping to improve this year ???? I tested out blogging in Scrivener last year, but it felt like overkill.\nRecently I’ve been doing a bit of editing in Google Docs and Word; the challenge is formatting. I collect a bunch of links and notes in a draft post, often add in some loose headers for structure, then copy and paste into the word processor. Annoyingly, block quotes and headings get lost when pasted back into WordPress. I only just realized last week that if I start from text view, then all the code gets brought into the word processor — it looks ugly and can be hard to parse while I’m working in it, but at least it preserves the formatting ????‍♀️ This isn’t ideal but probably better than writing only in-browser? TBD.\nI do incorporate previewing my writing often while editing in browser, and the word processor doesn’t allow that. (When previewing, I check for things like paragraphs that are too long or blocks of text that could benefit from more headings or bolded text for skimmability; I tend to write long so I want people to be able to figure out if they’re interested easily.)\n5. When do you feel most inspired to write?\nI’m inspired to blog all the time — so many interesting things happening online and in the world! — to the point I’m trying to shift away from leaning so much on inspiration. I still want to participate in the conversational web, but also want to be more intentional in what I spend time thinking about — to have a more balanced mix of posts in reaction versus self-prompted.\n6. Do you publish immediately or let it simmer a bit?\nI like to post anything short right away, but longer posts I’ll let sit. Sometimes I’ll write a post and run out of time to add one or two more paragraphs I think it needs, then I forget to come back for so long it doesn’t feel worthwhile to post anymore. Lately I’ve been working on cleaning up my drafts folder and stealing bits and pieces from posts that are never going up on their own.\n7. Your favorite post on your blog?\nOne favorite??? ???? I’m feeling super proud of my new mindset of more series, but I don’t know if that’s because I just wrote them ????\nFinding Enough Together is a post I link back to often. This is the type of post I think has the most value to write, and probably to read; it documents how my thinking has been shifting, tackles a Big Problem, and synthesizes a lot of reading. Tied up in that, for this particular post I’m really happy about the direction I’m moving in and feel good about the changes I’m making.\nI’m proudest of writing posts like this, though I always feel wary about coming across like I’ve figured everything out and have my act together, which I most certainly do not ????

These examples are a capsule of “my” Internet, the online culture vocabulary that I have found essential to my understanding of conversations in certain spaces.<h3>Online writing follows the rules of oral culture</h3>\n<p>As I pondered why my internet canon idea was a flop, I’ve drawn three conclusions about online writing:</p>\n<ol><li><strong>most internet writing is <a href=\"https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/a-place-to-talk\">part of oral culture</a></strong>; <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/19/long-live-hypertext/\">hypertext</a> allows more <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/\">conversational writing</a> that invites readers into a network by directly <a href=\"https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/a-final-word-on-blogs#bodyref2\">linking to other writers</a> while encouraging participation in the current Discourse</li>\n<li>because online writing is more relational than offline writing and <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing\">hypertext means a single post need not stand alone</a>, <strong>it is more often <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/01/15/understanding-blogs/\">an online writer’s <em>oeuvre</em></a> <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/01/30/a-decentered-argument-as-website/\">rather than a single post</a> that influences readers</strong>, and individual works are not necessarily intended to last; and sometimes an idea is within the community* and <strong>no one writer has synthesized it in one place</strong><br />*As <a href=\"https://thejaymo.net/2024/07/07/246-somewhere-inside-the-network/\">Jay Springett writes</a>, “The idea is fully expressed somewhere inside the network of links and discussions between people. Not anywhere in particular.” My example is the conversation the community has been having about connection between blogs, wherein I’ve collected <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/28/compromising-information/\">my piece of the conversation starting here</a>.</li>\n<li>because so much of how we read the Internet is rooted in relationships, and everyone has a different network, <strong>there is no one Internet canon</strong> — <a href=\"https://posting-nexus.ghost.io/untitled/\">everyone has their own</a></li>\n</ol><h3>Implications for online writing’s cultural and personal impact</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to pinpoint which particular piece of writing was the source of a revelation; often, no one piece is, but the chorus of voices together. It may not even come as a revelation, but a slow shifting. I couldn’t point to an individual #MeToo post that on its own was a turning point, but I will assert that the movement changed the way we talk and think about sexual violence. Even Cory Doctorow’s <a href=\"https://locusmag.com/2023/01/commentary-cory-doctorow-social-quitting/\">concept of enshittification</a> <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys\">emerged across several pieces</a>.</p>\n<p>Robert Poynton noticed that the valuable part of <a href=\"https://robertpoynton.substack.com/p/learning-without-teaching\">discussing books with others</a> was not the ‘content’ but the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What seems obvious to me now is that the ‘content’ of what is presented is not the most important thing, it is the other people and what they make of what they see (or feel, or notice) through the lens of their own experience.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Contrary to what you might expect, it turns out that the books aren’t actually that important. Where the conversations gain power and traction is not in the immediate reaction to the texts themselves, but in the cumulative and iterative responses to the responses.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The heart of the conversation Poynton describes is <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/\">how we write together online</a>: our blog posts, our tweets, our newsletters — the places where we collectively process and mash up and pass along ideas — are what make the internet worth reading.</p>\n<p>Sometimes bloggers think that nothing they write is valuable. Sometimes people never start to write because they think they have nothing worth saying. Sometimes people let their archives disappear or scrub them themselves (e.g. iirc the Nazi bar thread has been deleted). But that’s fear talking — because it is simply not true that online writing has no impact.</p>\n<p>Artemis <a href=\"https://artemis.sh/2024/01/17/duplicate-information.html\">points out the common fear bloggers have of repeating ideas</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the world of the digital, many of us have been tricked into thinking that something only needs to be said once. If someone has stated something, then stating it again is noise. Provides no purpose. Does not benefit anyone. The extension of this follows: I should not write something, on the off-chance that someone else whom I don’t even know about has already written it, perhaps better. The fear of being more incomplete than an imagined other-expert.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We want to provide genius, so we publish nothing, when in fact, repeating ideas is critical to how the internet works. Repetition is vital in oral culture.</p>\n<h3>If it’s all oral culture online, why does <em>writing</em> matter?</h3>\n<p>In a word, <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/09/19/long-live-hypertext/\">hypertext</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Online text is searchable</strong>. Without text, we have no archives. All record of the conversation is gone when it is not findable. And the way we search video? Text: tags, titles, and descriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Online text is easily linkable and quotable</strong>. Aural formats are getting better about clipping and responding to specific pieces of another video or audio snippet, but it’s more natural for text, where hypertext allows <a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/11/the-powerful-density-of-hypertextual-writing\">a powerful density of information</a>, as Jason Kottke puts it. If I want, I can link every word in a sentence to a different piece of evidence and allow the reader to follow links at their own discretion, backing up and expanding my argument without adding length. Video and audio are limited in what they can reference directly because each added recording requires more time. (I’m not counting the YouTube thing where they add a link overlaid on the video, which is so annoying and disruptive it can’t be used often.)</p>\n<p><strong>Online text is accessible</strong>, so more people can be included in the conversation. Audio and video are not accessible to Deaf viewers without captions or a transcript… <em>text</em>. Because it’s so much work to transcribe a podcast or video, most are automatically generated and less trustworthy / accurate. Meanwhile, blind readers can use text-to-speech tools to access text. Tools for translating text are more readily available than for translating spoken language (I believe — I’m not really in this space ????‍♀️).</p>\n<p><strong>And with text, we are in control of our experience</strong> in a way that is harder to achieve with aural media. Text is scannable, so I can quickly skim at a high level to determine if a piece addresses my interest. I can search the text for specific words and jump straight to the content I want; chapter markers in videos help, but are used inconsistently. I can pull out quotes more easily compared with listening to a podcast or video — I can copy and paste from text instead of transcribing by hand. I can change the size of the type and often the color scheme to suit my environment; while you can speed up something aural, it’s disruptive to the work since timing is often an important part of the delivery.</p>\n<h2>5 blog posts that changed my thinking</h2>\n<p>It’s rare for a single piece of online writing, on its own, to stand out the same way a traditionally published essay might, because it is <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2023/01/15/understanding-blogs/\">part of a larger whole</a>. <strong>Blogs influence by vibes</strong> moreso than specific, individual posts. Like the drip of water along a stalactite, it’s the accumulation of many posts — sometimes by one author, sometimes by multiple — that changes your mind.</p>\n<p>And then sometimes, <em>sometimes</em>, there <em>is </em>that one perfect tweet or provoking blog post.</p>\n<p>As a follow-up to collecting <a href=\"https://tracydurnell.com/2024/07/10/re-15-books-with-the-most-impact/\">my most impactful books</a>, I wanted to celebrate five specific blog posts that were impactful to <em>me</em>. These specific self-published online works gave me concepts that I still value today, or that served as turning points in my thinking.</p>\n(NB: I did not necessarily encounter these posts when they first were published.)<ol><li><a href=\"https://sive.rs/hellyeah\">No yes.

Sometimes people let their archives disappear or scrub them themselves (e.g. iirc the Nazi bar thread has been deleted). But that’s fear talking — because it is simply not true that online writing has no impact.\nArtemis points out the common fear bloggers have of repeating ideas:\nIn the world of the digital, many of us have been tricked into thinking that something only needs to be said once. If someone has stated something, then stating it again is noise. Provides no purpose. Does not benefit anyone. The extension of this follows: I should not write something, on the off-chance that someone else whom I don’t even know about has already written it, perhaps better. The fear of being more incomplete than an imagined other-expert.\nWe want to provide genius, so we publish nothing, when in fact, repeating ideas is critical to how the internet works. Repetition is vital in oral culture.\nIf it’s all oral culture online, why does writing matter?\nIn a word, hypertext.\nOnline text is searchable. Without text, we have no archives. All record of the conversation is gone when it is not findable. And the way we search video? Text: tags, titles, and descriptions.\nOnline text is easily linkable and quotable. Aural formats are getting better about clipping and responding to specific pieces of another video or audio snippet, but it’s more natural for text, where hypertext allows a powerful density of information, as Jason Kottke puts it. If I want, I can link every word in a sentence to a different piece of evidence and allow the reader to follow links at their own discretion, backing up and expanding my argument without adding length. Video and audio are limited in what they can reference directly because each added recording requires more time. (I’m not counting the YouTube thing where they add a link overlaid on the video, which is so annoying and disruptive it can’t be used often.)\nOnline text is accessible, so more people can be included in the conversation. Audio and video are not accessible to Deaf viewers without captions or a transcript… text. Because it’s so much work to transcribe a podcast or video, most are automatically generated and less trustworthy / accurate. Meanwhile, blind readers can use text-to-speech tools to access text. Tools for translating text are more readily available than for translating spoken language (I believe — I’m not really in this space ????‍♀️).\nAnd with text, we are in control of our experience in a way that is harder to achieve with aural media. Text is scannable, so I can quickly skim at a high level to determine if a piece addresses my interest. I can search the text for specific words and jump straight to the content I want; chapter markers in videos help, but are used inconsistently. I can pull out quotes more easily compared with listening to a podcast or video — I can copy and paste from text instead of transcribing by hand. I can change the size of the type and often the color scheme to suit my environment; while you can speed up something aural, it’s disruptive to the work since timing is often an important part of the delivery.\n5 blog posts that changed my thinking\nIt’s rare for a single piece of online writing, on its own, to stand out the same way a traditionally published essay might, because it is part of a larger whole. Blogs influence by vibes moreso than specific, individual posts. Like the drip of water along a stalactite, it’s the accumulation of many posts — sometimes by one author, sometimes by multiple — that changes your mind.\nAnd then sometimes, sometimes, there is that one perfect tweet or provoking blog post.\nAs a follow-up to collecting my most impactful books, I wanted to celebrate five specific blog posts that were impactful to me. These specific self-published online works gave me concepts that I still value today, or that served as turning points in my thinking.\n(NB: I did not necessarily encounter these posts when they first were published.)No yes. Either HELL YEAH! or no. by Derek Sivers – 2009\nHelping me turn down projects and save my energy for the things I really care about? Hell yeah! But seriously, actually choosing priorities and recognizing that our human limitations mean we don’t have time for it all is important. This approach also encouraged me to put greater stock in my emotional reaction to projects than obeying what I “should” do.\n\nHow I Went From Writing 2,000 Words a Day to 10,000 Words a Day by Rachel Aaron – 2011\nThis post (and the book it inspired) shifted the way I approach writing. I never got to 10k words a day, but this led me to recognize patterns in how, where, and when I write best. Also, using a bullet point / beat level outline made drafting so much easier!\n\nThe Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement by Pete Adeney – 2012\nI’d been reading personal finance blogs before this — mostly Get Rich Slowly iirc — but this post galvanized me into pursuing financial independence. While we’re more on the Coast FIRE train at this point, developing financial discipline early in my career helped me save enough to have FU money so I could quit my toxic job, and now work part-time.\n\nDon’t Make a Thing Out of It by David Cain – 2014\nI *totally* used to make a thing out of it. This helped me see that I was doing that — and (mostly) stop.\n\nHow to Be a Good Stranger by David Cain – 2014\nI apply this “secret ally” philosophy to driving, especially, which I think has helped me become a mellower driver.\n\nMost online writing would not meet the bar for traditional publication — but that doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable, or worth preserving. I still appreciate that these bloggers took the time to post their thoughts online where I could find them!\n \nThis post is my entry for the November 2024 IndieWeb Carnival, hosted by Alexandra on the theme of impact.\n \nFurther reading:\nHypertext, the Memex, and Collaboration as Socialization by Reilly Spitzfaden\nA place to talk by Mandy Brown\nStandalone but interconnected by Paul Watson\nHow to converse online by Manu Moreale\nA blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox by Henrik Karlsson\nLost in the Future by Ed Zitron"
