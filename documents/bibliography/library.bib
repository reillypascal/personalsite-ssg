  abstract = {An engaging argument about what experimental music can tell us about being human. In Experimenting the Human, G Douglas Barrett argues that experimental music speaks to the contemporary posthuman, a condition in which science and technology decenter human agency amid the uneven temporality of postwar global capitalism. Time moves forward for some during this period, while it seems to stand still or even move backward for others. Some say we're already posthuman, while others endure the extended consequences of never having been considered fully human in the first place. Experimental music reflects on this state, Barrett contends, through its interdisciplinary involvements in postwar science, technology, and art movements. Rather than pursuing the human's beyond, experimental music addresses the social and technological conditions that support such a pursuit. Barrett locates this tendency of experimentalism throughout its historical entanglements with cybernetics, and in his intimate analysis of Alvin Lucier's neurofeedback music, Pamela Z's BodySynth performances, Nam June Paik's musical robotics, Pauline Oliveros's experiments with radio astronomy, and work by Laetitia Sonami, Yasunao Tone, and Jerry Hunt. Through a unique meeting of music studies, media theory, and art history, Experimenting the Human provides fresh insights into what it means to be human.},

While glitch artists deploy a myriad of tools, tricks, and techniques, they all share the same hacker ethic: to take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it.5 For most glitch artists, however, it all started with a simple text editor. Like circuit bending, from which it gets its name, this is a process of trial and error, and it is a rite of passage for most glitch artists. The computer is on to us: in circuit bending, sometimes you go too far, adding a bend that causes the circuit to smoke and stop making sound; in databending, the worse-case scenario is an error message---less dangerous, but also less interesting. Each image file is a collection of numbers stored in the computer's memory.},

  abstract = {Sound, tone, music, voice, and noise as forms of sonority through which our current economic and ecological crises can be understood. In this wide-ranging book, Frances Dyson examines the role of sound in the development of economic and ecological systems that are today in crisis. Connecting early theories of harmony, cosmology, and theological doctrine to contemporary media and governance, Dyson uses sound, tone, music, voice, and noise as forms of sonority through which the crises of ``eco'' can be read. The sonic environment, Dyson argues, is fundamental to both sense and sensibility, and its delimitation has contributed to the ``senselessness'' of a world now caught between spiraling debt and environmental degradation. Dyson draws on scenes, historical moments, artworks, and artistic and theoretical practice to situate the reverberative atmosphere that surrounds and sustains us. From Pythagoras's hammer and the transmutation of music into mathematics, to John Cage's famous experience in the anechoic chamber, to the relocation of the stock market from the street to the computer screen, to Occupy Wall Street's ``people's microphone'': Dyson finds policies and practices of exclusion. The sound of Pythagoras's forge and the rabble of the market have been muted, rearticulated, and transformed, Dyson argues, through the monotones of media, the racket of financialization, and the gibberish of political speech. Informed by contemporary sound art, philosophy, media and sociopolitical theory, The Tone of Our Times offers insights into present crises that are relevant to a broader understanding of how space, the aural, and listening have shaped and continue to shape the world we live in.},

  abstract = {How to level up to the next transformative phase of publishing---with a critical methodology that transcends the dichotomy of paper and digital media production. Publishing is experiencing one of the most transformative phases in its history. In Tactical Publishing, a sequel to Post-Digital Print, Alessandro Ludovico explores the forces driving this historical phase, highlighting the tremendous opportunities it presents. Our task, he believes, is to develop an alternative publishing system that transcends the dichotomy between paper and digital media. He focuses first on the two activities on which publishing is premised---reading and writing (with an emphasis onwriting machines and post-truth in the latter)---and then deconstructs the concept, proposing alternative strategies inspired by recent practices and unconventional uses of technology. Ludovico shows how the radical and strategic use of print in the past can serve as the basis for our transition to the next phase of publishing. He argues that the new ecology of publishing should be based on three main elements: the stimulation of our senses, the role of software in forming the publishing infrastructure, and the importance of archives. During this transition from the current post-digital phase to the next phase, independent publishers and artists, as well as readers and machines, will enable new structures and actions that realize the potential of publishing and the preservation of content, thereby enriching social practices. The author also considers the crucial social role played by new forms of libraries, as artists and publishers shape the coming publishing world in its various manifestations. Combining analytical accounts of tactical strategies with examples from artworks and experimental practices, the book concludes with a manifesto for publishing in the twenty-first century and an appendix with a selection of one hundred publications representing the ``periodic table'' of future publishing.},

As an artist, Paglen is interested in the idea of photography as truth-telling, but his mysterious, compelling pictures o!en stop short of traditional ideas of documentation. Invisible highlights the array of tactics used by Paglen to depict both what can and cannot be seen. In the series Limit Telephotography, he employs highend optical systems to photograph top-secret governmental sites. In The Other Night Sky, Paglen works with the data of amateur "satellite watchers" to track and photograph classified spacecra! in Earth's orbit, while in other works he roots out revealing, yet arcane documents--passports, flight data, aliases of CIA operatives--and transforms them into art objects. Showcasing the artwork of an important emerging talent, Invisible speaks to the multidisciplinary practices employed by many of today's most interesting contemporary artists. Rebecca Solnit, noted author on culture and photography, contributes a searing essay that traces this history of clandestine military activity on the American landscape.},

  abstract = {What are the implications of computer vision in relation to machine learning and `artificial intelligence'? New York-based artist and writer Trevor Paglen argues that autonomous image-interpretation systems, from algorithms that analyse photos on Facebook to licence-plate readers used by police, constitute a new kind of visuality which is paradoxically largely invisible to human eyes. What is more, this new `invisible visuality' should be understood as a means of centralising power in the hands of the state and corporate actors who are able to deploy machine-vision systems at scale.},

  abstract = {In this close analysis of the song ``ringtone'' by 100 gecs, I unpack the dialectic of noisy and clean timbres, exploring this theme narratively, acoustically, and cognitively. My account, which serves as both a music theoretical and methodological case study, explains how two opposing timbral qualities---the clear, clean sound of the ringtone motive and the noisy, distorted timbres in the bass and voice---underscore the dynamic emotional contour of the lyrical narrative, at first supporting it and later, undermining it. I apply music theoretical approaches in conjunction with Wallmark's ASPECS model (Act, Sound, Perception, Experience, Conceptualization, Sign) as a framework for integrated analysis. First, I offer a timbral reading of ``ringtone'' using formal and functional layer analyses. Correspondences between my perceptions as an analyst and measurable features of sound are then examined via audio feature extraction using Timbre Toolbox and MIR Toolbox, revealing relationships between perceptual and acoustical noisiness, as represented by inharmonicity, auditory roughness, and normalized spectral centroid. Next, I adopt perspectives from embodied cognition and psychology to illustrate timbre's multivalence, explaining how the distortion in ``ringtone'' can simultaneously signify emotional distress and be experienced as pleasurable for listeners. I address conceptualization and signification through discussion of the contrast between the corporeality of inharmonic, noisy timbres and the immateriality of the virtual world as represented by the sine quality of the ringtone motive. More broadly, the analysis demonstrates how timbre conveys meaningful information that can engage with a lyrical narrative. Integrating methods from multiple disciplines (music theory, cognitive science, music informatics, and semiotics) provides emergent insight into the semantic flexibility of timbre that is not available via any single disciplinary perspective.},

This tendency leads to perfection since the user has to think too much about numbers, units, fractions, ratios, matrices, etc. and this premeditation lessens the likeliness of ending up with accidental developments. Those accidental actions are called ``Glitch''. While glitching as a medium for art is established, there is still much room for discussion on how glitching practice may be carried out. How can we apply accidental errors to form digital three-dimensional forms? is it applicable? in how much those errors can improve creativity and open new paths for three dimensional artists? in what ways may software development, made conducive to this kind of artistic creativity? This paper aims to explore glitching in three-dimensional forms as a creative design tool that can help artists and designers to follow new paths in digital aesthetics.},

Attention is focused on those devices employing delay loops. Usually, these devices have a comb-like frequency response which adds an undesired "color" to the sound quality. Also, for a given reverberation time, the density of echoes is far below that encountered in a room, giving rise to a noticeable flutter effect in transient sounds. A class of all-pass filters is described which may be employed in cascade to obtain "colorless" reverberation with high echo density.},
