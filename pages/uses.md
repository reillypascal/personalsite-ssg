This page is a list of software, stationery, and other tools I use — for the curious, and for those looking for recommendations.

A “/uses” or “/using” [slash page](https://slashpages.net/) is [a popular way among IndieWeb people of sharing this information](https://indieweb.org/using).

## Software

### Music Tools
- Audacity
- Dorico
- Logic Pro
- Max/MSP
- REAPER
- SuperCollider
- Tidal Cycles

### Developer
- Neovim ([dotfiles](https://github.com/reillypascal/kickstart.nvim))
- pluginval (validate and debug audio plugins)
<!-- - VSCodium (VS Code fork with alternative extension repository and no proprietary Microsoft components) -->
- WezTerm
- Xcode

### Web
- Firefox (web browser)
- Mailspring (desktop email client)
- Signal (encrypted messenger)
- Thunderbird (Android email client)

### Media
- AntennaPod (Android podcast player)
- Auxio (Android local music player)
- Lollypop (Linux music player aimed at GNOME desktop)

### Documents
- Calibre (e-book library manager/reader)
- Capy Reader (Android RSS reader)
- NetNewsWire (macOS RSS reader, also available for iOS)
- Obsidian (notebook; pairs nicely with Syncthing)
- Zotero (reference manager)

### Files
- FreeFileSync (easily manage backups)
- LocalSend (cross-platform file transfer)
- OpenMTP (transfer Android files to macOS)
- Syncthing (sync files over local network without needing cloud services)

### Utilities
- Aegis (2fa)
- Bitwarden (password manager)
- DAVx<sup>5</sup> (CalDAV/CardDAV/WebDAV manager for Android)
- Droid-ify (F-Droid FOSS app store client)
- Forkyz (FOSS Android crossword app)

- ItsyCal (macOS taskbar calendar)
- LinearMouse (remap mouse input without requiring official Logitech software)

### Operating Systems
- macOS
- Arch Linux
- Ubuntu Server (for [my home server](/wiki/notebook/tech-projects/tv-media-server/))
- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) (mobile)
    - I particularly like GrapheneOS, which is an alternative, privacy/security-focused version of Android. The [web-based installation option](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) is extremely easy, and it's also easy to revert to stock Android. The sandboxed Google Play services make it easy to run pretty much any app you can use on stock (except NFC payment, unfortunately), or you can leave them off and have a completely Google-free experience.

- Hongdian Peacock

- Robert Oster, “Sydney Lavender” and “Aqua”
