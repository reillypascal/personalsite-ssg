I do not use large language models (LLMs) or any other form of “generative AI” in any capacity in any of the writing, music, code, or images on this website.

While [the reasons I oppose “generative AI” are numerous](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism), the most important to me is labor solidarity. As [Aaron Benanav comments](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst),

> The real threat posed by generative AI is not that it will eliminate work on a mass scale, rendering human labour obsolete. It is that, left unchecked, it will continue to transform work in ways that deepen precarity, intensify surveillance, and widen existing inequalities.

As both a musician and a programmer, I see this opposition to “generative AI” as connected to the historical movement of the [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite)—skilled textile workers who fought back against the degradation of their working conditions through automation. As [described by the blog which shares their name](https://theluddite.org/about.html), the people of this movement

> were sophisticated technical operators who destroyed machines not out of ignorance, but because, in their specific social and political context, those new machines guaranteed their immiseration.

My refusal is not out of a rejection of new technology, but because of the anti-worker nature of a specific set of technologies, and the ideologies that are inextricably connected to those technologies.
