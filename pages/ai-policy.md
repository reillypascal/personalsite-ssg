I do not use large language models (LLMs) or any other form of “generative AI” in any capacity in any of the writing, music, code, or images on this website.

While [the reasons I oppose “generative AI” are numerous](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism), the most important is labor solidarity. I see “generative AI” as [an ideology](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/toolmen) and a [rhetorical device](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-crisis-is-here-now) used to justify worsening labor conditions and disempowering workers. As [Tracy Durnell comments](https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/02/generative-ai-and-the-business-borg-aesthetic/),

> Generative AI — both imagery and text — is inextricable from the corporate vision for its use: a world in which [workers are powerless and worthless](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic), replaced by “free” generated material.

As both a musician and a programmer, I see this opposition to “generative AI” as connected to the historical movement of the [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite)—skilled textile workers who fought back against the degradation of their working conditions through automation. As [described by the blog which shares their name](https://theluddite.org/about.html), the people of this movement

> were sophisticated technical operators who destroyed machines not out of ignorance, but because, in their specific social and political context, those new machines guaranteed their immiseration.

My refusal is not out of a rejection of new technology *per se*, but because of the anti-worker nature of a specific set of technologies, and the ideologies that are inextricably connected to those technologies.

<!-- I've started collecting a [list of writing](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism) in my wiki that relates to my stances on AI.

> I think we should shed the idea that AI is a technological artifact with political features and recognize it as a political artifact through and through. AI is an ideological project to shift authority and autonomy away from individuals, towards centralized structures of power.
