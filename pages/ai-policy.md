<h1 class="sectionHeader">AI Policy</h1>

I do not use large language models (LLMs) or any other form of “generative AI” in any capacity in any of the writing, music, code, or images on this website.

For writing my blog posts, I type them by hand in Neovim, using the `codebook` spell-checker to catch typos. Code is similarly written in Neovim using [this list](https://github.com/reillypascal/nvim/tree/main/lsp) of language servers to catch errors, and [this collection](https://github.com/reillypascal/nvim/blob/main/lua/plugins/conform.lua#L31) of formatting tools to achieve consistent use of line breaks, etc. — both categories use traditional code parsing, rather than LLMs.

For the images, I design SVGs (or edit existing ones, such as logos) in Inkscape, touch up and scale photos in GIMP and/or ImageMagick, and cite e.g., digital signal processing diagrams from papers or other discussions when relevant.

I keep [a list of my primary music software here](/uses/#music). While some of these programs ship with features the manufacturers describe as “AI” (e.g., Logic Pro has the ability to extract instrumental or vocal “stems” from a completed recording), I do not use these features in any of my composition or production.

I maintain [a page of readings critical of “generative AI”](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism), sorted by category, and which I regularly update. These readings are a good summary of some of my main issues with the technology.

While [the reasons I oppose “generative AI” are numerous](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism), the most important to me is labor solidarity. As [Aaron Benanav comments](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst),

> The real threat posed by generative AI is not that it will eliminate work on a mass scale, rendering human labour obsolete. It is that, left unchecked, it will continue to transform work in ways that deepen precarity, intensify surveillance, and widen existing inequalities.

As both a musician and a programmer, I see this opposition to “generative AI” as connected to the historical movement of the [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite)—skilled textile workers who fought back against the degradation of their working conditions through automation. As [described by the blog which shares their name](https://theluddite.org/about.html), the people of this movement

> were sophisticated technical operators who destroyed machines not out of ignorance, but because, in their specific social and political context, those new machines guaranteed their immiseration.

My refusal is not out of a rejection of new technology, but because of the anti-worker nature of a specific set of technologies, and the ideologies that are inextricably connected to those technologies.
