I do not use large language models (LLMs) or any other form of “generative AI” in any capacity in any of the writing, music, code, or images on this website.

I've started collecting a [list of writing](/wiki/reading/ai-criticism) in my wiki that relates to my stances on AI.

> I think we should shed the idea that AI is a technological artifact with political features and recognize it as a political artifact through and through. AI is an ideological project to shift authority and autonomy away from individuals, towards centralized structures of power.
