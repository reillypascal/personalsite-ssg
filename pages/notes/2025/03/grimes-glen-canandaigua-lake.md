Today we went hiking in Grimes Glen in Naples, NY and stopped by Carolabarb Park, a small scenic outlook over Canandaigua Lake.

  <figcaption>I made some field recordings of the creek at Grimes Glen. There were several waterfalls like this throughout the creek. This time I brought my nice field recorder instead of using my phone.<figcaption>

My partner has been very into mushrooms and other fungi lately, so we looked for them in the woods at Grimes Glen. They tell me that viewing will be much better in the summer, but we still saw some interesting ones — primarily [polypore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore) or shelf fungi.
