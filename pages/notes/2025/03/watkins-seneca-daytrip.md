I went with my partner to the [Watkins Glen](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/watkinsglen/maps.aspx) and [Seneca Lake](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/senecalake/details.aspx) state parks, both on Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes. I've started taking more pictures lately (nice new camera phone, and better organization for my photo gallery have both encouraged me to do so), so here's a photo blog of our day.

First, here are some pictures from Watkins Glen. They have a gorge trail most of the way down the gorge, but because of the season it's currently closed. We hiked on the higher rim trail and could see down into the gorge from it.

  <figcaption>My partner thought this stone bench looked like something people would get sacrificed on, so they asked me to take a picture that looked like that had happened.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I really like airplanes/contrails and photos of the sky.</figcaption>

Watkins Glen is at the far end of Seneca Lake from us, and on the way home, we stopped by Seneca Lake State Park on the opposite end (since it's one of the [Finger Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Lakes), it's very long and skinny).

  <figcaption>Finally, I always love to collect photos of roof antennas/weather stations at parks, and it amuses my partner greatly. Here's one at Seneca Lake State Park.</figcaption>

In addition to microblogging, I plan to use my [notes](/notes) page and its [feed](/notes/feed.xml) as a replacement for things like Instagram — this way I own all my photo posts. My partner and I are looking for more state parks and cool geography to visit, so I'll be posting more of this kind of thing.
