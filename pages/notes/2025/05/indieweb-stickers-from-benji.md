Benji made some [IndieWeb stickers](https://www.benji.dog/notes/1733601983/) that look like a metal band logo, and he sent me one — thanks! He also included some other fun stickers, shown below. The metal one and the goose with a floppy are what I put on my laptop so far, and as the note says, the goose/floppy is from [alistairshepherd.uk](https://alistairshepherd.uk/).

There is a metal band logo-style sticker that says 'IndieWeb'; a goose holding a floppy; stickers from Chappell Roan, Aphex Twin, and Magdalena Bay CD packaging; a Blockbuster ticket that reads 'Fire-Toolz'; a Kodak Brownie Target Six-20 camera; the logo for the local Archivist Books bookstore; an EFF one reading 'I do not consent to the search of this device'; and a Wikipedia 'citation needed' icon from Molly White.](/media/notes/2025/05/IMG_20250511_172404_375.webp)

![A note with several stickers laid on it. There is a sheet of benji.dog 88x31 banners; a pair of 'you wouldn't hack the planet' stickers; a microformats logo; and an IndieWeb Camp logo.](/media/notes/2025/05/IMG_20250511_165243_131.webp)
