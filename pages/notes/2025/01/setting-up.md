I'm adding a new page to my site. I want the blog feed to be for longer, more thought-out articles, but I also like the idea of having a "microblog"-style (e.g., Mastodon/Bluesky/etc.) feed that's on my own site. Feels more in line with [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) principles of owning what I post.

I'll be adding an additional RSS feed for my notes, and I think it could be cool to do one for my [likes](https://reillyspitzfaden.com/likes), and maybe even add a photo blog (to serve a similar function to Pixelfed/Instagram).
