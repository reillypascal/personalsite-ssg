My partner and I went to the Rochester Museum and Science Center's planetarium for the “[Stars with Carl](https://rmsc.org/events/stars-with-carl/)” event this past weekend. The “Carl” in question is a 1968 [Carl Zeiss Mark VI star projector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeiss_projector) — a fully analog unit that if I remember right, weighs over 2 tons. 

The presenter showed us how the skies change with season and latitude, and demonstrated “[star hopping](https://milwaukeeastro.org/beginners/starhopping.asp)” between different stars and constellations. I took some pictures of Carl at the end — a very cool machine:

There is a blue sphere covered in lenses at each end and a number of projectors and lenses mounted on and around the truss.](/media/blog/2025/04/stars-with-carl/IMG_20250405_194437_613.webp)
