I went with my partner to the Natural Stone Bridge & Caves park in the Adirondacks for their birthday. They love rocks and geology, and really wanted to go here.

From what they told me, this park was originally gifted to a family as thanks for their efforts in the American Revolutionary War, and after a long time as a sawmill, later members of the family converted it to a park.
