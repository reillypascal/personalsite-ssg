My partner and I went to Bergen Water Gardens & Nursery for their lotus festival, celebrating when the lotus flowers bloom. In lieu of pictures, I'm going to describe some of my favorite things I saw there, but first, here's why I'm doing that.

## Why Words Instead of Pictures

I've been enjoying taking pictures of my nature trips with my partner and sharing them on my website. However, I often find that taking pictures takes me out of the momentâ€”instead of focusing on what I'm seeing, I think about how something is going to look for my website. I recently learned of writer [Everett Ruess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Ruess) who wrote numerous letters describing his travels in California and the American Southwest. These were posthumously published in two collections, [one of which can be found here](https://archive.org/details/everettruessvaga00rush). 

When I read some of his letters, I appreciated the descriptions of nature, and it inspired me to try my hand at that kind of description. As I've [previously written](/posts/2024/06/making-journaling-more-enjoyable/) I like fountain pens and use them to journal, and I've done some writing in this style in my journal already and confirmed I like it.
