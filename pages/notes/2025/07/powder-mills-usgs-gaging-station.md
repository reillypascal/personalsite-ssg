My partner and I took a walk at Powder Mill Park in upstate NY to look at the mushrooms and fish hatchery. While we were there, I came across the transmitter for a [United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gaging station](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-430252077283402/)—you can go to the link and see the data from this station.

I've been interested in cataloging the stations I see since I saw Sarah from Signals Everywhere's [video on the transmitters for these stations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT8AIp-DlrM). I previously [found one](https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal/111915520145252626) at Ellison Park and got some pictures of both the transmitter and what I believe is the sensor. According to Sarah, the stations uplink the data in the UHF band (~401 MHz) to the [GOES weather satellites](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php), which relay the data back down for processing by the [National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS)](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/). My photos from today are below:

I've long thought it would be cool to connect the data from these to some sort of musical result, but I haven't figured out a satisfying way to do that—a way to both make the data meaningfully present in the music *and* make interesting music, rather than something blandly demonstrative of the data.
