James posted a ["Which HTML element are you Quiz?"](https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/13/html-quiz) and I got the following results:
> You are the `<a>` element!
> Anchors like to connect ideas and people, just as the link helps connect HTML documents.
>
> Your nested element is `<blockquote>`.
> You like to think about ideas from multiple places and connect them.
>
> Did you have fun filling out the quiz? Share the URL with friends!
>
> Want to take the quiz again? Refresh the page.

> [`<a>` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
> [`<blockquote>` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

I like doing these kinds of web games — thanks for putting this together, James! If other people want to do this, I think it would be fun to see what you get as well.
