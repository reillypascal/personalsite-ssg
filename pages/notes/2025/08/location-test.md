Jo has been using [the code I use to get post locations](https://github.com/reillypascal/personalsite-ssg/blob/fcec4c251b343b0e53f9f8d0dd2689f27c9cbf9c/status#L5) for [my /now page statuslog section](/now) to [add locations to her notes](https://dead.garden/notes/). I realized it would be nice to add it to [the script I use to generate note templates](https://github.com/reillypascal/personalsite-ssg/blob/main/note) as well!

While most of my blog posts are written from home and not associated with a place, I have a [number](/notes/2025/07/photoblog-natural-stone-bridge-caves/) of [notes](/notes/2025/07/powder-mills-usgs-gaging-station/) from trips with my partner that aren't just in Rochester.

I like the “vibe” of connecting things on my site to a physical place, so this should be nice to add.
