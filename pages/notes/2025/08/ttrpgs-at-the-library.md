My local library has a TTRPG group (currently playing Pathfinder 2e). I sat in on a campaign today, the group was very welcoming, and I'm excited about it.

I've wanted to get into D&D/TTRPGs for a while, but didn't have a group to do it with. While I hear Pathfinder is a bit more involved than some, I was able to get a copy of the rulebook to take home, and I'm invited to give it a go with making my own character and joining the party next weekend. I enjoyed how it felt like manually stepping through a computer simulation â€” the whole time I was thinking of [Ben Eater's videos about building a 6502 computer on a breadboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH&index=2&t=1300s), in which he uses a pushbutton for a clock pulse at some points to manually step through things.

Lately I've been looking for 1) [more things to do off the internet](/notes/2025/08/re-turning-towards-the-positive/) and 2) ways to make friends in my area. I made a lot of good friends in grad school, but now most of them have moved; the scarcity of academic jobs means a lot of moving around T-T. I've never been great at putting myself out there, so most of my friendships have developed from being in proximity to a lot of people, which doesn't work the same way out of school. This group seems lovely though, and I'm glad I pushed myself to give it a try.
