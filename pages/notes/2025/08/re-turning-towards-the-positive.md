[Tracy Durnell's recent post](https://tracydurnell.com/2025/08/27/turning-towards-the-positive/) resonates with what I've been doing lately to make my computer usage more pleasant.

I've been in the habit of compulsively checking notifications (Mastodon, RSS, YouTube subscriptions, etc.), and I figured out that staying away from that, and using my computer for local things is much nicer. A few specific local things I've been enjoying:

- I've wanted to learn the live-coding tool [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) for a while now, and I'm finally doing that. [Here's a Tidal Cycles performance by Lil Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db0QJo1eaoI), and [here's one by Moxus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjf-NJNfOP4) (super glitchy and noisy!). This tool is nice because I can code _and_ have my coding be immediately musical.

- I've started knitting, and my goal is that once I'm comfortable with some basic stitches, I can use code to generate patterns. I was inspired to do this by [Sophia's project using p5.js to generate knit beanie patterns](https://www.fractalkitty.com/w/). This is a nice way to feel connected to my programming/computer interests without actually needing to be online or even use a computer for the full project.
