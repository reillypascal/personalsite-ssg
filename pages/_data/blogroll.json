For my do‚Äôs, I am a pianist, composer, aspiring musicologist, and perpetual player of any game by FromSoftware. As for who I am, I am an autistic trans lesbian in my mid twenties, lover of my wife and cats, and my life thus far has been a gradual descent into the stranger realms of art. I‚Äôll be reflecting on art, artists, the sort of work I love, and the sort of work I want to make as I move through a world that is increasingly hostile to people like me.",
