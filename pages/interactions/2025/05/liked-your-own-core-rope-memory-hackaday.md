> While rope memory superficially resembles core memory, the principle of operation is different. In core memory, the coreâ€™s magnetization is what determines any given bit. For rope memory, the cores are more like a sensing element. A set wire tries to flip the polarity of all cores. An inhibit signal stops that from happening except on the cores you want to read. Finally, a sense wire weaves through the cores and detects a blip when a core changes polarity.
