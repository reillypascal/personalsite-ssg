I've been enjoying [Meljoann's](https://meljoann.com/) new album [Status](https://meljoann.com/posts/status/) — definitely check it out! They describe their music as “hyperjack” — the hyperpop cousin of late 80s/early 90s new jack swing artists like Janet Jackson — and the album is full of rage at the capitalist and technological systems that oppress us. 

The video for ”Rainbow Language (Is For Losers)” in the linked article is full of psychedelic sets and otherworldly costumes (including a plastic trash bag!), and like all Meljoann's videos, it's on the Fediverse on [PeerTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube).
