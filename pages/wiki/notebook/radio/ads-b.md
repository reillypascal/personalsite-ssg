ADS-B, or [Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast) is a system for sharing the position of aircraft in flight. The aircraft carries a transponder, which receives positioning data — often from satellite navigation — and continually broadcasts this position for reception by ground control or other aircraft.

I also see this type of signal referred as Mode S, such as in the [dump1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) documentation.

I use an [RTL-SDR](/wiki/notebook/radio/rtl-sdr) dongle to receive these signals.

## Software

- dump1090
  - Install: `git clone https://github.com/antirez/dump1090.git`, run `make` (successful on macOS 14.7.5 and on Raspberry Pi after following [these instructions](/wiki/notebook/radio/rtl-sdr#raspberry-pi)).
  - Run:
    - `./dump1090` — basic run command
    - `./dump1090 --raw` — hexadecimal output
    - `./dump1090 --interactive` — shows table view in terminal
    - `./dump1090 --interactive --net` — shows on <http://localhost:8080/>
  - Source: <https://github.com/antirez/dump1090> — last updated Jan 21, 2024; most updates 9–13 years ago
- tar1090 + graph1090 — look into this combination for web interface
