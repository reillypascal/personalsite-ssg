## About This Page

- [Olia Lialina on linking](https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/links.html)

> Ten years ago every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to configure the environment and build the infrastructure. The many-to-many principle showed itself in linking strategies as well. A site was not complete without links to other sites.
