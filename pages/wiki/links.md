description: "Links to reading, tools, and other resources for DSP, computer music, and the Web.\n\n As Olia Lialina notes, at one point “every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to… build the infrastructure” of the Web. As search engines crumble, I find curation by humans ever more valuable."

## About This Page

> Ten years ago every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to configure the environment and build the infrastructure. The many-to-many principle showed itself in linking strategies as well. A site was not complete without links to other sites.

— _Olia Lialina_, [A Vernacular Web](https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/links.html) (2005)

### Classical

- [Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Project](https://www.mikerepper.com/coleridge-taylor-project.html) from conductor Michael Pepper

> In celebration of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's 150th Birthday Anniversary, the creative team has created modern performance editions (scores and parts) of
> _Toussaint L'Ouverture, Ballade Op. 4_, and the Suite from “24 Negro Melodies,” each of which is offered for free to any ensemble wishing to study or perform this music.

As described [here](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/14/nx-s1-5496512/samuel-coleridge-taylor-150-avril-black-british-classical), the motivation for this project is that the parts for _Toussaint_ were “riddled with errors and essentially unusable in their delivered conditions,” and Coleridge-Taylor's legacy deserves good quality scores and parts.

## Old Media

- [TWC Classics](https://twcclassics.com/)

> TWC Classics is the oldest and largest website devoted to The Weather Channel. Created during the summer of 1997, TWC Classics has amassed a large collection of audio, video, images, and information. Over 8,000 files and counting! Join me in taking a nostalgic look back at The Weather Channel's first 28 years.

- [Trammell Starks / Information / TWC Classics](https://twcclassics.com/information/trammell-starks.html)
  - Trammell Starks composed some of the most well-known music for The Weather Channel. I first learned about him when Angel Marcloid (of Fire-Toolz, Nonlocal Forecast, and more) [shared his music](https://fire-toolz.tumblr.com/post/183966509639/this-nonlocal-forecast-mix-offers-smooth-jazz-fit) as something that inspires her. [She even did a cover of his song “Life”](https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/life). Listening to Fire-Toolz, as well as composers like [Alex Temple](https://www.alextemplemusic.com/), I've come to appreciate “cheesy” music like this.

### Hypertext

- Mike Caulfield, [_The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral_](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

> The Garden is an old metaphor associated with hypertext. Those familiar with the history will recognize this. The Garden of Forking Paths from the mid-20th century. The concept of the Wiki Gardener from the 1990s. Mark Bernstein’s 1998 essay Hypertext Gardens.

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.
