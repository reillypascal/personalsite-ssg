description: "Links to reading, tools, and other resources for DSP, computer music, and the Web.\n\n As Olia Lialina notes, at one point “every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to… build the infrastructure” of the Web. As search engines crumble, I find curation by humans ever more valuable."

## About This Page

> Ten years ago every web site had a section of external links because people felt it was their personal responsibility to configure the environment and build the infrastructure. The many-to-many principle showed itself in linking strategies as well. A site was not complete without links to other sites.

— *Olia Lialina*, [A Vernacular Web](https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/links.html) (2005)
