        <h3>Currently Reading</h3>
        <p><a href="https://subcutanean.textories.com/"><cite>Subcutanean</cite></a> by Aaron A. Reed</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This book is <em>amazing</em>. I'm about halfway through, and it's very "The Backrooms."</li>
        </ul>
        <p><cite>Count Zero</cite> by William Gibson</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I read <cite>Neuromancer</cite> (the previous book in the series) and really liked that. I'm just getting started with <cite>Count Zero</cite>, but it's also shaping up to be a great time.
        </ul>

        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <p>I've learned enough Rust to get started on an <a href="https://github.com/reillypascal/rs_rust_audio">audio library</a>. My plan is to use this as the source to build a plugin in Rust, but I think it'll be helpful to figure out the basic audio processing before trying to learn a new plugin toolset outside of JUCE.</p>
