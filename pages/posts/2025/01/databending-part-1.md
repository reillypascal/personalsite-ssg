title: Databending Part 1
description: Did you know you can listen to pretty much any file as an audio file? In this post I'll explain how it works, and in the next, I'll go into more depth about composing with these sounds.

Let's start today off with some sounds right out of the gate:

<audio controls>
  <source src="/media/blog/2025/01/Finale.7_23.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

What you're listening to is a segment of the recently departed [Finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finale_(scorewriter)) notation program being treated as an audio file. Notice how the tone and [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) *almost* sound like a drum machine. The rhythm is in a wonderful place between random and regular â€” there are sequences of sounds that almost repeat, and that almost sound like a kick-snare dance beat, but it's not *quite* regular enough to dance to. It reminds me of something Autechre might do (see e.g., <cite>[Tapr](https://autechre.bandcamp.com/track/tapr)</cite> at around 1 minute, or <cite>[VI Scose Poise](https://autechre.bandcamp.com/track/vi-scose-poise)</cite>).

This process of treating non-audio data as if it is audio (along with other such artistic data reinterpretations) is often called "[databending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databending)." Today I'll talk about how this reinterpretation works, how to do it using simple tools such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and begin to look at how I and other musicians use this in music. In further post(s), I will dive deeper into analyzing music and art that uses this and similar techniques.
