Continuing from [a previous post](/posts/2025/06/reverb-part-1), today we'll be looking at another collection of reverb algorithms that I've implemented in my [reverb plugin](https://github.com/reillypascal/RSAlgorithmicVerb/releases).

My main reference for the theory behind this is the article “[A Realtime Multichannel Room Simulator](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/92/4_Supplement/2395/646024/A-real-time-multichannel-room-simulator)” by Bill Gardner. [^1]

## Nested Allpass Filters

As we [previously discussed](/posts/2025/06/reverb-part-1/#allpass-filters), an allpass filter is created by a feedforward and feedback delay in series, with the gain of one of them being negative. This lets all frequencies through at equal amplitude, but delays different frequencies by different amounts, “smearing” or “blurring” the rhythmic attacks of an incoming sound, which is excellent for simulating reverberation.

Gardner takes this idea a step further. Where the Schroeder reverb from our last discussion places multiple allpass units in series, Gardner looks to combine the allpasses “in a way that will lead to an exponential buildup of echoes as occurs in real rooms.” To do this, he replaces the delay inside an allpass filter with another allpass filter, creating a nested structure. After demonstrating that, if the inner delay unit $G(z)$ is allpass, the entire configuration is also allpass, he notes that

> The echoes generated by the inner allpass filters will be recirculated to their inputs via the outer feedback path. Thus, the number of echoes generated in response to an impulse will increase over time rather than remaining constant as with a standard allpass filter. [^2]

### Implementing Nested Allpasses

Take all allpass filters from different “taps” in a single delay line
