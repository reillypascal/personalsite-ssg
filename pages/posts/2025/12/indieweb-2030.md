In February 2024, [Anil Dash wrote](https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/) that “‘wherever you get your podcasts’ is a radical statement.” Podcasts are — at their core — an RSS feed of audio files, which can be read and brought into any service on which you want to listen. Given the continued moving toward closed platforms, the inherent openness of podcasts, Dash argues, is powerful. At the time, I had [just recently become interested in the IndieWeb](/posts/2024/01/hello-world/), and reading these words gave me some hope.

Since then, I've [heard](https://www.theverge.com/c/24238422/podcast-etymology-term-history-tech-vergecast) from a few different sources the comment that YouTube is becoming the biggest podcast platform — “it's not even close,” [comments](https://www.derekthompson.org/p/why-everything-became-television) Derek Thompson. For the moment, it is still possible to follow YouTube channels via RSS. However, this fact is not so widely known among non-tech people, and after the death of Google Reader, and the effects of that death on blogging, I don't feel inclined to trust Google-owned YouTube to keep even this degree of openness around forever.

Anil Dash's article is no longer available on his site. At time of writing, it gives a 404 error, and is only readable via [this archived link](https://archive.ph/sFVMS). As I struggle to keep hope in even the small wins toward openness, this loss feels fitting. The lone and level sands stretch far away.

## The Future of the IndieWeb

V.H. Belvadi is [hosting this month's IndieWeb Carnival](https://vhbelvadi.com/indieweb-carnival-future) about where we see the IndieWeb in 2030. The longer I pay attention to technology, the less I feel equipped to picture the future. Instead of trying to guess what will come, today I'm talking about what makes me despair in the present, and thinking through those feelings, and to a more productive path forward.

## Postscript

These things we build are so frail. So many answers to the question of how to move forward, to be healthier, to be safer from being manipulated and used. So easy for answers to fall apart. So easy for them to survive, zombie-like, in some form, but fail to touch many people.

At the very least, we can try. We must try.
