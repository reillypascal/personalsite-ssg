Here's some of the music I've listened to this year — things in regular rotation, things from a while ago that I've revisited, and new (or new-to-me) music I've discovered.

## New Listens

### Charli XCX

I've listened to Charli XCX since before _Vroom Vroom_ came out, but as is often the case with artists I like, I've been moving quite slowly through her discography. I hadn't given _Number 1 Angel_ a proper listen, but I currently have “Lipgloss” on repeat. I love the over-the-top, scratchy synth design, and I actually tried my hand at recreating the lead part, to some success. Looks like the key is something that has a bright, buzzy formant — I tried using a kick drum-based wavetable, and some oscillator sync.

### Fire-Toolz

Interbeing: “Yellow Rose-Fire”

### William Fields

I got to see William Fields live with Autechre in Philadelphia, and this next one is actually a live recording of that concert! It was very cool to see live, and I'm glad he decided to release the set. It's available [here](https://williamfields.bandcamp.com/album/opening-for-autechre-in-philadelphia) on Bandcamp.

## Revisited

Subtle and 13 & God are both groups I loved in high school, and I've been listening to them again this year. Both groups are related: 13 & God is a collaboration between members Doseone and Jel of Subtle (among other groups), and The Notwist. Both groups perform a mix of early 2000s alternative hip hop, trip hop, and indie rock, with rapper Doseone performing in a strange, dense style with dreamlike, abstract lyrics.

## Regular Rotation

## Postscript

<!-- As I [mentioned last year](/posts/2024/12/music-listened-this-year), I _despise_ Spotify, and with everyone talking about their

[Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/actions/spotify-whacked/) has some information on problems with Spotify and some action steps to take, including more ethical alternatives. -->
