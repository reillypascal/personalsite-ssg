I was recently compelled to re-watch David Cronenberg's 1983 film [_Videodrome_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videodrome). For some time, I've been feeling deeply unpleasant sensations, both emotional and physical, in connection with the medium of video. I've had a growing sense of connection between those sensations and the world of _Videodrome_.

In the film, Max Renn is the CEO of a small TV station, which broadcasts “everything from soft-core pornography to hard-core violence.” He stumbles across (what appears to be) a pirate broadcast of a program called _Videodrome_, which depicts a single red room in which people are tortured and killed. He becomes fascinated with this, believing it would be a hit if his station were to broadcast it, and as he digs deeper, he experiences (often violent) hallucinations centering on televisions and video tapes.

Max eventually learns that there is a signal hidden in _Videodrome_ that stimulates hallucinations via a brain tumor. He learns that the show was never actually a broadcast, but a recording he was shown in order to brainwash and recruit him to the cause of destroying his station colleagues and others who are too obsessed with sex and violence.

There are two things in this film that particularly stuck with me. The first is the observation by “media prophet” Brian O'Blivion that

> The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain. Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television.

While in the film, O'Blivion's words have a more literal truth as Max's reality is replaced with video-induced hallucinations, even outside of the film, these words started me thinking about video as something that (in a sense) physically exists in my body, or is at least has a deep, physical connection.

The second thing that stuck with me is the way the special effects transform televisions, screens, videotapes, and other technology into living, breathing things, often in violent, disturbing ways. Their surfaces pulsate and ripple. The mouth of radio host Nikki Brand (who is sexually involved with Max) bulges out of the television screen, and Max sinks his face into the flexible membrane, trying to kiss Nikki. After Nikki has initiated sadomasochistic play with Max, he later finds himself in the _Videodrome_ room with a rippling, breathing television set, showing Nikki's face and shoulders, and he whips the television, to the enjoyment of the Nikki it displays.

Videotapes' surfaces balloon and ripple like flesh as the tapes let out loud, scratchy inhalations. Barry Convex — one of the people seeking to brainwash Max — violently shoves one such breathing tape into a slit that has opened in Max's stomach as a means of “programming” him to kill.

The imprint of a hand holding a gun presses through a screen, distorting and stretching it, and the static snow is replaced with a pink, veined, and fleshy texture, becoming strangely wet and diseased. After the gun fires through the membrane, the imprint recedes, leaving the shape of a man's chest riddled with bullet holes on the screen.

When I looked at the pulsating, inhuman television-made-flesh and thought that it felt familiar, that it felt the same as when I look at short-form video online, I did a double take. Why did I feel that way? What am I supposed to take away from that?

## Auto-Sensory Ethnography of Video

In ethnographer Tomie Hahn's book [_Sensational Knowledge: Embodying Culture through Japanese Dance_](https://www.weslpress.org/9780819568359/sensational-knowledge/), she looks at her own sensory and bodily experiences in learning [_nihon buyo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-buy%C5%8D) — classical Japanese dance.

<!-- All of this has come together with the vague sensations I have been feeling around video, and seems to point me to a kind of unpleasant connection between video and my body. -->

Video writes itself deeply onto my body

Short form content emotional whiplash

auto sensory ethnography

body as a site for knowledge

what I hear from my body is that there are many types of video I receive as malignant

I feel my forehead start to throb and a subtle nausea in my gut

## Kinds of Video

The uses of video that make me feel this way seem to include:

high volumes of short-form and/or low-quality video

I know at least that I don't want to give up film or TV. Especially since my partner is a film/TV buff, this is something over which I can feel close to them.

## Why Write about This?

Given the vast number of technology critiques, particularly in my online circles, why write more? What does this add to the discussion? I have two goals for my contribution.

First, this film came out in 1983, when television was much younger than today, and home video was less than a decade old. [^1] As I watched, I felt the film “defamiliarize” video for me. The film leaves behind the sense of video itself as new and threatening, not just modern uses of it (AI slop, algorithmically-delivered short-form Content™, etc.)

Defamiliarizing technologies has been a productive way for me to shift my relationship to them. Cell phones (and the expectation to be always available) became popular within the last few decades. Knowing this reminds me that these expectations are not a given, and in fact are wide open for critique. I was reminded recently that even the answering machine produced a marked shift in expectations around communication, that the effects of something that has existed for my entire life, and has been obsolete for over a decade can still be questioned. [^2]

Second, the film is visceral and disgusting. There's something about watching a pulsating, breathing videocassette shoved into a screaming man's stomach that deeply captures my sense of technological malaise and alienation. If I tell someone that scrolling social media is unhealthy, it's so obvious as to appear trite. But what if I say it in a different way?

> Don't you feel it too? That sickening sensation as a parade of sludge attaches itself to your retinas yet again? That's not a metaphor; it's there. It's inside you. Visualize its presence in your body. It's stuck to you, and you can't wash it off.

My experiences with this film and how it's shifted my feelings about video have made me think about how disgust attaches itself to the brain in a deeper way than abstract knowledge. When I tell myself not to do something, it's so easy to say “just this once.” When it disgusts me — when every TikTok or Reel comes with the image of the breathing tape, the television screen of flesh pierced by a gun, something that's inside me and cannot be removed, no matter how much I might want to — well that's much harder to ignore.

## Postscript

I want to be very clear that I do not intend this to be prescriptive. It's based on my highly subjective personal experiences, which, as in Tomie Hahn's writing, I think are interesting to analyze. If you genuinely like your short-form video content, I don't want to take that from you or malign your character. However I do want to ask you to indulge me for a moment. Why not try thinking this way about video? If it doesn't resonate with you, no harm done. If it does though, maybe it can offer some clarity.

<!-- When it stems from just and honest critiques of the world, I wonder if it might allow us to _know_ much more fully that something is wrong.  -->

<!-- Criticism of television's effect on the brain feels old-hat at this point, and sometimes I forget how recent video is as a medium.

There are many critiques of short-form video, social media, and other similar aspects of online life. The reason I'm writing this is that _Videodrome_ left me feeling that those don't always look quite far enough. -->

Professor Brian O'Blivion, described as a “media prophet,” tells Max via videotape that he is responsible for the _Videodrome_ signal, explaining that

> I had a brain tumor, and I had visions. I believe the visions caused the tumor and not the reverse. I could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh. Uncontrollable flesh.

This tumor, the recording of O'Blivion says,

Max's assistant Bridey stops by Max's apartment with some tapes, including one sent directly from Prof. O'Blivion. As Max opens the tape, it lets out a loud, scratchy inhale, and the surface balloons and ripples like flesh. Max drops the tape in surprise.

> The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain. Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television.

> Your reality is already half video hallucination. If you're not careful, it will become total hallucination. You'll have to learn to live in a very strange new world. I had a brain tumor, and I had visions. I believe the visions caused the tumor and not the reverse. I could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh. Uncontrollable flesh.

> I believe that the growth in my head — this head, this one right here — I think that it is not really a tumor. Not an uncontrolled, undirected, bubbling part of flesh, but that it is in fact a new organ. A new part of the brain. I think that massive doses of the Videodrome signal will ultimately create a new outgrowth of the human brain which will produce and control hallucination to the point that it will change human reality. After all, there is nothing real outside our perception of reality, is there? \[chuckles\] You can see that, can't you?

Barry Convex, of the Spectacular Optical Corporation

Convex holds out a videotape which breathes and ripples, as O'Blivion's tape did previously. As Max's shirt flies open and the slit in his stomach opens again, Convex places the tape inside Max's stomach as a means of “programming” him. Afterward, Max sits on the floor as metal rods break in and out through his skin, binding a gun to his hand. Convex's voice sounds in his head, directing him to kill his colleagues and Bianca O'Blivion.

Bianca escapes by showing Max a tape of Nicki being killed on _Videodrome_. As she tells him that “_Videodrome_ is death,” the TV screen fades to static and distorts like a rubber sheet, showing the imprint of a hand holding a gun, before becoming pink and veined, and looking like skin. The gun fires, striking Max, and the imprint on the screen recedes, leaving it looking like a human chest with bullet holes.

As Bianca explains, this reresents a “reprogramming” of Max, removing Convex's influence and bringing him to O'Blivion's cause — to destroy _Videodrome_. Bianca continues, telling him that “you've become the video word made flesh,“ and leaves him with the slogan “Death to _Videodrome_. Long live the new flesh.”
