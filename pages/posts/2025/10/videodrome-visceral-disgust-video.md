I was recently compelled to re-watch David Cronenberg's 1983 film [_Videodrome_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videodrome). For some time, I've been feeling deeply unpleasant sensations, both emotional and physical, in connection with the medium of video. I've had a growing sense of connection between those sensations and the world of _Videodrome_.

In the film, Max Renn is the CEO of a small TV station, which broadcasts “everything from soft-core pornography to hard-core violence.” He stumbles across (what appears to be) a pirate broadcast of a program called _Videodrome_, which depicts a single red room in which people are tortured and killed. He becomes fascinated with this, believing it would be a hit if his station were to broadcast it, and as he digs deeper, he experiences (often violent) hallucinations centering on televisions and video tapes.

Max eventually learns that there is a signal hidden in _Videodrome_ that stimulates hallucinations via a brain tumor. He learns that the show was never actually a broadcast, but a recording he was shown in order to brainwash and recruit him to the cause of destroying his station colleagues and others who are too obsessed with sex and violence.

There are two things in this film that particularly stuck with me. The first is the observation by “media prophet” Brian O'Blivion that

> The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain. Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television.

While in the film, O'Blivion's words have a more literal truth as Max's reality is replaced with video-induced hallucinations, even outside of the film, these words started me thinking about video as something that (in a sense) physically exists in my body, or is at least has a deep, physical connection.

The second thing that stuck with me is the way the special effects transform televisions, screens, videotapes, and other technology into living, breathing things, often in violent, disturbing ways. Their surfaces pulsate and ripple. The mouth of radio host Nikki Brand (who is sexually involved with Max) bulges out of the television screen, and Max sinks his face into the flexible membrane, trying to kiss Nikki. After Nikki has initiated sadomasochistic play with Max, he later finds himself in the _Videodrome_ room with a rippling, breathing television set, showing Nikki's face and shoulders, and he whips the television, to the enjoyment of the Nikki it displays.

Videotapes' surfaces balloon and ripple like flesh as the tapes let out loud, scratchy inhalations. Barry Convex — one of the people seeking to brainwash Max — violently shoves one such breathing tape into a slit that has opened in Max's stomach as a means of “programming” him to kill.

The imprint of a hand holding a gun presses through a screen, distorting and stretching it, and the static snow is replaced with a pink, veined, and fleshy texture, becoming strangely wet and diseased. After the gun fires through the membrane, the imprint recedes, leaving the shape of a man's chest riddled with bullet holes on the screen.

When I looked at the pulsating, inhuman television-made-flesh and thought that it felt familiar, that it felt the same as when I look at short-form video online, I did a double take. Why did I feel that way? That's a rather extreme response, isn't it? What am I supposed to take away from that?

## Auto-Sensory Ethnography of Video

In ethnographer Tomie Hahn's book [_Sensational Knowledge: Embodying Culture through Japanese Dance_](https://www.weslpress.org/9780819568359/sensational-knowledge/), she looks at her own sensory and bodily experiences in learning [_nihon buyo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon-buy%C5%8D) — classical Japanese dance. Hahn's ideas have been highly influential on the “sensory turn” in ethnography, and on treating the body as a site of knowledge. [^1] My ideas on video here originated from sensory responses in my body, so I'll take her approach and analyze my own sensory experience.

First is TikTok. While I haven't had the app on my smartphone since January, and I haven't opened the web app in months, I'll return to it to analyze the sensations that were among the many reasons I stopped going there.

_Bang_

In a flash of light and sound, the first video starts playing.

Every time a longer video comes up, I feel time slow down and a headache start to build. Even if the video would be interesting, it feels like an imposition

I have no preparation before anything plays

When videos are playing, I feel dissociated

When I pause, I feel a lead weight descend on me

I don't know if I want to watch a given video in full, but often the “hook” is intriguing enough that to move on would leave an itch in my brain as I wonder what the ending was

I feel pummeled with sensation

pounds me into hypnotic state

rapid change of emotional state

short and not particularly interesting; not enough to satisfy, so I want more, but because I'm motivated to keep scrolling for more, anything longer than 20–30 seconds is frustrating.

hypnotic, numbing, and I struggle to express how I even feel beyond that

what I hear from my body is that there are many types of video I receive as malignant

## Kinds of Video

The uses of video that make me feel this way seem to include

high volumes of short-form and/or low-quality video

things that didn't need to be a video

mining one's personal/everyday life for Content™

In the other direction, there are a number of uses of video that don't bother me, or that I actively enjoy. First is film and TV. Since my partner is a film/TV buff, this is something over which I can feel close to them. I also have a personal enjoyment for film/TV that's well-made or at least meaningful to me — after all, I started this post by analyzing a film. These uses of video especially work for me if I get my recommendations from friends, my partner, or publications that review film/TV in genres I like, or by e.g., following links from other things I like on Wikipedia. This addresses both the issue of too high a volume of video, and of getting things recommended by algorithms I don't trust, as would happen if I found things by browsing a streaming platform.

I also find some uses of video for illustrative purposes to be inoffensive or positive. For example, the blog “Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects” frequently embeds short (~30 second) videos in writeups of projects. [This post on running the “Dexed” Yamaha DX7 emulator on a Raspberry Pi](https://diyelectromusic.com/2022/04/28/bare-metal-raspberry-pi-minidexed-dx7/) has a video that illustrates what the project looks and sounds like when finished, which is useful information that video conveys very effectively. Crucially, the rest of the tutorial is text, diagrams, and photos, not video.

## Why Write about This?

Given the vast number of technology critiques, particularly in my online circles, why write more? What does this add to the discussion? I have two goals for my contribution.

First, _Videodrome_ came out in 1983, when television was much younger than today, and home video was less than a decade old. [^2] As I watched, I felt the film “defamiliarize” video for me. The film leaves behind the sense of video itself as new and threatening, not just modern uses of it (AI slop, algorithmically-delivered short-form Content™, etc.)

Defamiliarizing technologies has been a productive way for me to shift my relationship to them. Cell phones (and the expectation to be always available) became popular within the last few decades, for example. These expectations don't have to be a given, and are wide open for critique. Keeping this in mind helps me (for example) to let go as I work to have my smartphone on me for less of the day. I was reminded recently that even the answering machine produced a marked shift in expectations around communication, that the effects of something that has existed for my entire life, and has been obsolete for over a decade can still be questioned. [^3]

Second, the film is visceral and disgusting. There's something about watching a pulsating, breathing videocassette shoved into a screaming man's stomach that deeply captures my sense of technological malaise and alienation. If I say that scrolling social media is unhealthy and we should do it less, it's so obvious as to appear trite. But what if I say it in a different way?

> Don't you feel it too? That sickening sensation as a parade of sludge attaches itself to your retinas yet again? That's not a metaphor; it's there. It's inside you. Visualize its presence in your body. It's stuck to you, and you can't wash it off.

My experiences with this film and how it's shifted my feelings about video have made me think about how disgust attaches itself to the brain in a deeper way than abstract knowledge. When I tell myself not to do something, it's so easy to say “just this once.” When it disgusts me — when every TikTok or Reel comes with the image of the breathing tape, the television screen of flesh pierced by a gun, something that's inside me and cannot be removed, no matter how much I might want to — well that's much harder to ignore.

## Postscript

I want to be very clear that I do not intend this to be prescriptive. It's based on my highly subjective personal experiences, which, as in Tomie Hahn's writing, I think are interesting to analyze. If you genuinely like your short-form video content, I don't want to take that from you or malign your character. However I do want to ask you to indulge me for a moment. Why not try thinking this way about video? If it doesn't resonate with you, no harm done. If it does though, maybe it can offer some clarity.

<!-- It's an emotionally-charged depiction of police harassment. I didn't know I was going to see that, so there was no time to prepare. My heart rate accelerates, but I have already entered a hypnotic state that dulls my awareness of what I'm feeling.

After a few more police misconduct videos, we get an extremely energetic and enthusiastic presenter talking about the structure of the Milky Way. I like the topic, but again, I had no idea this was coming before scrolling. This is interesting, but I also don't want to stay — it feels like an imposition
