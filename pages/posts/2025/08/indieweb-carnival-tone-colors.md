title: "IndieWeb Carnival: Tone Colors"
description: For this month's IndieWeb Carnival, I'm writing about music that emphasizes timbre or “tone-color,” and how this kind of approach appears in my own composition.

[Movement III, “Farben” (“Colors”)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AQx0V2lZs8&t=496s) from Arnold Schoenberg's *Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16* begins very subtly. Two different groups in the orchestra alternate on the same hushed, eerie chord. As this slow, regular pulsation continues, some notes in the chord move up or down very slightly while others remain the same, gradually transforming the harmony. 

Throughout the movement, there is almost no melody in the traditional sense. Rather, by keeping the pitch material nearly static while alternating different instruments (or combinations of instruments), Schoenberg foregrounds the [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre) or “tone-colors” of the orchestra — the aspects of sound by which we can tell, for example, a trumpet from a violin.

He describes what he is doing as [*klangfarbenmelodie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klangfarbenmelodie) or “tone-color melody.” By composing this way, he seeks to have the listener perceive this changing of “tone-colors” with “a kind of logic entirely equivalent to that logic which satisfies us in the melody of pitches.” [^1] Just as a more traditional melody might have a distinctive sequence of pitches (often associated with a similarly distinctive rhythm), we can apply the same type of listening to a sequence of *timbres*, as well as writing music that encourages this type of listening.

## Color in My Earlier Music

In my first year of college, I stumbled across a score page for Anton Webern's [*Concerto for Nine Instruments, Op. 24*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVQambrIKNo) discarded in a practice room — likely homework from some classmate's [20th-century music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th-century_classical_music) class. Webern was one of Schoenberg's students and someone who also made use of *klangfarbenmelodie*, and this piece was my entry point to that idea (among many other musical concepts). Some 13 years later, it's interesting to look back on what has changed and what has stayed the same in how I use color in my music.

When I wrote my *Nonet* in 2014 (see [movement III in particular](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/nonet-iii?in=reilly-spitzfaden/sets/nonet-premiere)), Anton Webern was one of my favorite composers. I can hear the similarities with Webern's *Concerto* in the short, angular, dissonant [motives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)) with large leaps between notes; in the way short ideas are rapidly passed between instruments, emphasizing tone color; and in the sparse, pointillistic [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_(music)), among other features. 

Webern also tended to write [12-tone rows](https://openmusictheory.github.io/twelveToneBasics.html) (the basic melodic/harmonic material in [12-tone music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique)) with high amounts of internal consistency. For example, the row in his *Concerto* [is based on 4 copies of the same 3 notes/2 intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_for_Nine_Instruments_(Webern)#Composition) — a minor second and a minor third (e.g., B♭, B, and D). Even when the order of those notes is varied or the grouping is [transposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(music)) up or down to build the row, there is a consistent feeling or “vibe” to the harmony and melody created by this symmetry. 

Just as the more obvious stasis in the opening chords of Schoenberg's “Farben” movement allows and encourages us to focus on the timbre, so does the consistent “vibe” to Webern's pitch material. When I listen to Webern, I often allow my hearing to blur, this consistent quality to emerge, and timbre to take over in lieu of pitch. This pitch symmetry (and the resulting emphasis on timbre and overall sound) is another quality of Webern's music that appeared in my own earlier writing, including my *Nonet*.

## Color in My Recent Composition

I composed [*If this reaches you*](https://applytriangle.bandcamp.com/track/if-this-reaches-you) in 2021, and [it was recorded in 2024](/posts/2024/04/new-album-announcement/).

## Wrapping Up

Marisabel is hosting [this month's Indieweb carnival on the topic of colors](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/IndieWeb_Carnival_August_2025_:_Colors), and this is my contribution. I had been looking forward to writing on this topic since I saw it on [the list of upcoming events](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival). I've been enjoying other people's entries, and thanks to Marisabel for hosting!

I've particularly enjoyed this exercise of looking at my past work because it has given me some ideas for a current composition project. Since I'm out of school, I tend to write for fewer performers than when I wrote my *Nonet*. For my current project (MIDI keyboard, oboe, clarinet), I've wanted to have some feedback sounds as I did in e.g., [*Outlive everything you know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dz0iKwHrkI), using a microphone and small amplifier. The sections of [my *Nonet*, Mvt. III](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/nonet-iii?in=reilly-spitzfaden/sets/nonet-premiere) like e.g., 0:52, with each instrument playing a single note that swells and interlocks with similar notes in other instruments gave me an idea. I realized that I could attach [a clip-on contact mic](https://www.korg.com/us/products/tuners/cm_300/) to the instrument bells and
