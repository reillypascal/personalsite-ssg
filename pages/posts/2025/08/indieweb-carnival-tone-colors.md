[Movement III, “Farben” (“Colors”)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AQx0V2lZs8&t=496s) from Arnold Schoenberg's *Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16* begins very subtly. Two different groups in the orchestra alternate on the same hushed, eerie chord. As this slow, regular pulsation continues, some notes in the chord move up or down very slightly while others remain the same, gradually transforming the harmony.

Throughout the movement, there is almost no melody in the traditional sense. Rather, by keeping the pitch material nearly static while alternating different instruments (or combinations of instruments), Schoenberg foregrounds the [timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre) or “tone-colors” of the orchestra — the aspects of sound by which we can tell, for example, a trumpet from a violin.

He describes what he is doing as [*klangfarbenmelodie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klangfarbenmelodie) or “tone-color melody.” By composing this way, he seeks to have the listener perceive this changing of “tone-colors” with “a kind of logic entirely equivalent to that logic which satisfies us in the melody of pitches.” [^1] Just as a more traditional melody might have a distinctive sequence of pitches (often associated with a similarly distinctive rhythm), we can apply the same type of listening to a sequence of *timbres*, as well as writing music that encourages this type of listening.

## Color in My Earlier Music

In my first year of college, I stumbled across a score page for Anton Webern's [*Concerto for Nine Instruments, Op. 24*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVQambrIKNo) discarded in a practice room — likely homework from some classmate's [20th-century music theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th-century_classical_music) class. Webern was one of Schoenberg's students and someone who also made use of *klangfarbenmelodie*, and this piece was my entry point to that idea, among many other musical concepts — see my *Nonet* 2014, and [movement III in particular](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/nonet-iii?in=reilly-spitzfaden/sets/nonet-premiere), for example. 

Where Schoenberg's prototype of *klangfarbenmelodie* in his “Farben” movement uses slowly morphing chords, the opening of Webern's *Concerto* is highly pointillistic. In the first three measures, the oboe, flute, trumpet, and clarinet each play a 3-note pattern one after another, with each instrument just barely overlapping with the end of the previous one. This rapid passing of short ideas between instruments sets the tone for the rest of the composition. 

We can listen to this pointillistic call-and-response in a similar way to how we did in the Schoenberg example. Note that all the (usually) 3 note-long fragments have a similar “vibe” to them — 3 notes, all the same length, leaping a great distance in once direction, and then (often) leaping back the other way. [^2] While the stasis in the Schoenberg example is more obvious, this constant self-similarity in Webern's piece gives a kind of stasis as well. If we allow our hearing to “blur” and focus on the overall quality, rather than trying to follow the dissonant, angular melodies, the rapid *klangfarbenmelodie* shifts in tone color become clear. 

This pointillistic way of rapidly passing ideas between instruments appeared regularly in my earlier compositions, such as in the opening of [my *Nonet*, mvt. III](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/nonet-iii?in=reilly-spitzfaden/sets/nonet-premiere), and as I wrote this way, I took particular interest in the shifting timbres that resulted.

## Color in My Recent Composition

Some 13 years after my *Nonet*, it's interesting to look back on what has changed and what has stayed the same in how I use color in my music. I composed [*If this reaches you*](https://applytriangle.bandcamp.com/track/if-this-reaches-you) in 2021, and [it was recorded in 2024](/posts/2024/04/new-album-announcement/). The details of my approach are very different, but the emphasis on sound and timbre, and the pointillistic, thin textures are still there. This piece is for MIDI keyboard (controlling a custom software setup in [Max/MSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software))), flute, and clarinet. The flutist briefly uses a bass bow on a cardboard box in the middle, as well. The MIDI keyboard plays a combination of electric piano and sampled amateur radio sounds — [I wrote about using radio transmissions in my compositions in another post](/posts/2024/12/radio-listening-musically/).

Where the things that made the *Nonet* sound unusual were the choice of pitches and rhythms, in *If this reaches you*, the focus is a bit more on *sound* than pitch. In addition to the “non-musical” radio samples, I also use a number of so-called “extended techniques,” particularly in the clarinet. [Clarinetist Heather Roche's blog](http://www.heatherroche.net/) is a great source of information on how these work, and I use [various](https://heatherroche.net/2018/09/13/27-easy-bb-clarinet-multiphonics/) different [multiphonics](https://heatherroche.net/2019/11/05/underblown-bb-clarinet-multiphonics/), [double trills](https://heatherroche.net/2014/05/11/on-double-trills-for-bb-clarinet/), and other unusual sounds. At the same time, the way I combine these sounds is still quite pointillistic, and emphasizes rapid shifts between the different kinds of noise.

When I do use clearly pitched material, my more recent compositions tend to be a bit more “tonal” than the *Nonet* — less chromatic, and leaning more toward “cheesy” 80s pop, lounge music, or electronic dance music sounds. For example, the piano chords — both notes and instrument sound — in [*If this reaches you*](https://applytriangle.bandcamp.com/track/if-this-reaches-you) starting at around 0:58 sound like lounge/elevator music mixed in amid the noisy samples and flute/clarinet sounds. The synth chords and scooping accents in the sax melody in [the opening of *Outlive everything you know*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dz0iKwHrkI) sound reminiscent of house music, again mixed in with a kaleidoscope of strange glitches and multiphonics.

Someone I admire who manages to pull together ”cheesy“ synth sounds with experimental electronics (as well as metal and many other things!) is Fire-Toolz. Listen how the opening of [*Soaked: Another Name for Everything*](https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/track/soaked-another-name-for-everything) moves from acoustic guitar to 80s power ballad to glitchy sound collage, to some sort of prog-rock/elevator music hybrid at the end. Extremely colorful, and while her music is very different from Schoenberg, the quick movement between different tone colors is an integral part of her work too.

## Wrapping Up

Marisabel is hosting [this month's Indieweb carnival on the topic of colors](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/IndieWeb_Carnival_August_2025_:_Colors), and this is my contribution. I had been looking forward to writing on this topic since I saw it on [the list of upcoming events](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival). I've been enjoying other people's entries, and thanks to Marisabel for hosting! I've particularly enjoyed this exercise of looking at my past work because it has given me some ideas for a current composition project — more info on that as I compose. Until next time!

<!-- I've particularly enjoyed this exercise of looking at my past work because it has given me some ideas for a current composition project. Since I'm out of school, I tend to write for fewer performers than when I wrote my *Nonet*. For my current project (MIDI keyboard, oboe, clarinet), I've wanted to have some feedback sounds as I did in e.g., [*Afterimage from*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_inKSy9K0k&t=41s), using a microphone and small amplifier, while also having the clarinet and oboe players free to play their instruments at the same time.

My [*Nonet*, mvt. III](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/nonet-iii?in=reilly-spitzfaden/sets/nonet-premiere) has some sections such as e.g., 0:52 with each instrument playing a single note that swells and interlocks with similarly-played notes in other instruments. While I was listening back to this movement, my mind jumped around a bit and I realized that I could attach [a clip-on contact mic](https://www.korg.com/us/products/tuners/cm_300/) to the instrument bells, allowing each player to cover two sounds at once and/or staggered with each other — one traditional sound or [multiphonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiphonic), and one feedback tone by moving toward/away from the amp. 

This would allow me to get the interleaved crescendos/decrescendos sort of like what I did in the *Nonet*, and also get some nice ASMR-like sounds from the key clicks, sort of like in [Marcos Balter's *Wicker Park*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_EbQ2CQhog&pp=ygUZd2lja2VyIHBhcmsgbWFyY29zIGJhbHRlcg%3D%3D), but amplified. I'll be talking to some performers I know and trying this out when I resume teaching in the fall, and it should be interesting. It'll definitely expand the range of tone colors I can get out of the small ensemble. -->

[^2]: For the interested, the [12-tone row](https://openmusictheory.github.io/twelveToneBasics.html) in this piece is also highly [invariant](https://openmusictheory.github.io/twelveToneMusicInvariance.html). [The row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerto_for_Nine_Instruments_(Webern)#Composition) consists of 4 repetitions of the same group of 3 notes/2 intervals, and as such, some ways of transposing it and/or playing it in reverse (“[retrograde](https://openmusictheory.github.io/twelveToneOperations.html)”) will leave some of the notes the same. This further contributes to the consistent “vibe” in the harmony, and means the 3-note groups should all be the same [pitch-class set](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/pc-sets-normal-order-and-transformations/).
