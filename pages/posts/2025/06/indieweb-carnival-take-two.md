title: "IndieWeb Carnival: Take Two"
description: I've been mostly making music tools rather than writing music. Today I'm talking about getting out of this rut with a “take two” on my current composition.

Nick Simson is hosting [this month's IndieWeb Carnival](https://www.nicksimson.com/posts/2025-indieweb-carnival-take-two.html) on the theme “take two.” After having needed to pick a new topic, he writes

> Ever wish for a do-over? “Take two!” (or three, four, etc.) might be shouted by a film director or audio engineer looking to get a somewhat different outcome from a group of actors or musical performers. Would you like a second shot at something that didn’t land?

I immediately thought of my current experience of composing when I read this. I have a composition that I started back in summer 2023 for which I still haven't written much in the way of notes on the page. I tend to start a composition by working in [Max/MSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)), usually using some combination of [databending](/posts/2025/01/databending-part-1) and [software-defined radio](/notes/2025/05/tracking-planes-with-a-raspberry-pi) (SDR) [samples](/posts/2024/04/new-album-announcement/); [sequenced/probabilistic sample/synth patterns](/posts/2024/05/composition-journal); and VST synths/electric pianos, with these different categories assigned to different regions of a MIDI keyboard.

In addition to patching in Max, this process requires composing samples (usually in Logic Pro) to “glitch up” or otherwise manipulate in Max; digging through large collections of “databending” files; sessions of scanning the airwaves on my SDR equipment and recording what I hear; and more recently, coding projects such as my [script to glitch up MP3s](/posts/2025/04/databending-part-3/), my [tool to automate the databending process](/posts/2025/05/databending-part-4/), or my [implementation of the VOX ADPCM codec](/posts/2025/05/databending-part-5/) to get more variety in databending.

Nathan Ho [describes what he calls “system-building syndrome”](https://nathan.ho.name/posts/system-building-syndrome/). For context, 

> Synthesizer forums have a long-running joke about “Gear Acquisition Syndrome” that pictures the stereotypical hobbyist with all their Hainbach-endorsed gear, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they’re intended for making music.

In using [SuperCollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider) and C++ to make his own versions of this kind of gear, he comments that

> I thought I was being clever circumventing \[Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS)] by building everything myself, but what really happened is that I had fallen into my own version of GAS: I had System-Building Syndrome.

As I program and patch my own electronic music tools and setups, I find myself in the exact same position of making music tools instead of actually making music. For my “take two,” I'll discuss why I seem to have ended up here and some recent thoughts about composition that I'm hoping are taking me out of this rut.

## How Did I Get Here?
