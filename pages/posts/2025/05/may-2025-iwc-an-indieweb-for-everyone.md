Chris chose this month's theme of “[small web communities](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/may-2025-indieweb-carnival-small-web-communities/)”



1. How do we make the IndieWeb as accessible, safe, and inviting as possible?
2. How do we best communicate the value of what we're doing?
3. How do we ensure that what we're offering is actually beneficial?


We could emphasize that simple is plenty, and welcome those who want to keep it simple. It's possible to make a webpage with just the HTML below. Add a few headings and paragraphs and you've got a post! A few links to other pages, and it's an index of your posts. Blake Watson's [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) set of tutorials is a great resource if you want to make a simple HTML site.

For the community aspect, Webmentions are great (see my [collection of tutorials](/digital-garden/tutorials/webmention-tutorial/), which includes beginner-friendly ones), but they can be a barrier for many. A simple email link, as in the template below, is plenty to allow someone to contact you, and you can also “[POSSE](https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/)” your posts on whatever social media or chat platforms you like.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf8">
		<title>Title</title>
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- content goes inside the <body> section -->
		<a href="mailto:reillypascal@gmail.com">Contact me!</a>
	</body>
</html>
```

Even these things require some degree of both technical know-how and being comfortable searching for technical answers online. As I write about the “simple” options for making a website, I'm reminded of the evergreen [XKCD #2501](https://xkcd.com/2501/).  

Additionally, someone has to be *interested in doing this*. 

I don't have a definite answer for all this. I do want to encourage people to step out of their comfort zones and try out some basic HTML

Need to make these communities valuable to broader population

No matter how much I value something, if I go up to someone and tell them “this is the way” without making it clear how what I offer benefits them, what I offer isn't going to do much good.
