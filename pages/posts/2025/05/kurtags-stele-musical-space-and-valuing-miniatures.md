I recently re-listened to György Kurtág's “[Stele](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WiqCwQ8nJhY)” for large orchestra while finishing up some grading for the semester. A student seemed apologetic for the stretches of open space in a composition project, which included piano arpeggios backed by strings that imitated the piano resonance, and which trailed off into silence before the next chord. I found that spaciousness particularly effective, and I pointed them to the short, echoing bursts of chords followed by orchestral resonance in the [third movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiqCwQ8nJhY&t=6m38s) of “Stele.” I particularly like this effect, [^1] and both the music and some biographical facts about Kurtág have been helping me in how I think about my composition.


## Vertical & Horizontal Space

I tend to write thin textures, but with events happening in quick succession, and I often vary ideas immediately, rather than sitting with something for a while. 


Reminded of the value of miniatures and how it's okay to take time in between compositions and not have a prolific output

How that relates to what I'm trying to avoid

[^1]: The score from [a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99485avrXaU&t=6m30s) in ep. 10 of *Serial Experiments Lain* has a similar draw for me, with an obsessively repeating 3-note piano pattern, wide spaces between repetitions, and metallic, reverberant sounds doubling the piano at times. 

Also see my composition [*Multiplicity*](https://soundcloud.com/reilly-spitzfaden/multiplicity-premiere-11-18-15) at around 2:13–3:03, where I use polyrhythmic, echoing layers of chords. It was actually while I was working on this piece that a professor pointed me toward mvt. 3 of “Stele.”
- Note that this is much denser horizontally
