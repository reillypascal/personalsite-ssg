description: I'm learning to use the old film camera I never got around to trying! It's a nice analog hobby that seems to be keeping my attention, and it relates well to my fountain pen/journaling interest.

Something like 10–15 years ago I acquired an analog SLR camera (a Minolta X-370), but I never actually learned how to use it. It sat in storage at my mom's house in Michigan until recently, when she visited for my wedding. It still works, and all I needed were batteries (for the light meter/shutter) and film, plus I found a lens cap and strap to keep it safe.

I've been wanting more offline and/or analog hobbies, and I'm hopeful that photography will keep my attention. Since I learn best from books, I found _Analog Photography_ by Andrew Bellamy, and that's been a nice read — to the point, clear, and has enough info without overloading me. Today I'll talk about some of the things I've learned, my experience using the camera, and some of the results I got.
