I've been in the mood to see some space horror lately. I saw a promotion for _Ash_ (2025), which looks like a solid B-movie, and that reminded me to add _Sunshine_ (2007) and _Event Horizon_ to my watch list. I've also been wanting to watch more movies with my husband, so _Alien_ is perfect for all of that. This is a re-watch for both of us — we've seen it (and _Aliens_) before, and liked them a lot.

contrasting sound environments emphasize otherness of the alien, impending danger; separate narrative strands will converge.
