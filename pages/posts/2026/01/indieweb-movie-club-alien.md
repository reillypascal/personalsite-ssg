January's IndieWeb movie club is _Alien_ (1979), and it's hosted by Al Abut — [here is his introduction post for the month](https://alabut.com/writing/alien1979/). I've been in the mood to see some space horror lately. I saw a promotion for _Ash_ (2025), which looks like a solid B-movie, and that reminded me to add _Sunshine_ (2007) and _Event Horizon_ to my watch list. I've also been wanting to watch more movies with my husband, so _Alien_ is perfect for all of that. This is a re-watch for both of us — we've seen it (and _Aliens_) before, and liked them a lot.

## Sound Design

A few things stood out to me about the sound design of the film. The first happens a few times throughout. When the initial exploration party leaves the ship, the sound environments inside/outside the vessel have a stark contrast, and the cuts between them are immediate.

Cuts

Harsh noise to quiet interior

Cut rapidly from attack

Coolant loading/Ripley in shuttle sound toggle

contrasting sound environments emphasize otherness of the alien, impending danger; separate narrative strands will converge.

Soft classical music - diegetic (Howard Hanson)

Heartbeat clanking in ship
