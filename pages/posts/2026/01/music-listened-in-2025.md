Here's some of the music I've listened to in 2025 — things in regular rotation, things from a while ago that I've revisited, and new (or new-to-me) music I've added to my library of digital downloads/CDs.

## New Listens

### Charli XCX

I've listened to Charli XCX since before _Vroom Vroom_ came out, but as is often the case with artists I like, I've been moving quite slowly through her discography. I hadn't given _Number 1 Angel_ a proper listen, but I currently have “Lipgloss” on repeat. I love the over-the-top, scratchy synth design, and I actually tried my hand at recreating the lead part, to some success. Looks like the key is something that has a bright, buzzy formant — I tried using a kick drum-based wavetable, and some oscillator sync.

### Fire-Toolz

Fire-Toolz' first album, _Interbeing_ came out in 2017. I first heard of her with 2018's _Skinless X-1_, and while I bought _Interbeing_ shortly after, I never really got into it until this year. This is common with me — Autechre, for example is pretty much my favorite group, but it took me a long time to get into albums other than _Confield_ and _Draft 7.30_. This year I found that I actually really like the first track on _Interbeing_, “Yellow Rose-Fire.”

### William Fields

I got to see William Fields live with Autechre in Philadelphia this October, and this next one is actually a live recording of that concert! It was very cool to see live, and I'm glad he decided to release the set. It's available [here on Bandcamp](https://williamfields.bandcamp.com/album/opening-for-autechre-in-philadelphia). William Fields [uses REAPER's JSFX scripting tools](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/turning-code-into-music-anagrams-open-source-marxism-and-vr-raves/) to create custom interfaces for glitchy, rhythmically uneasy algorithmic music.

### Autechre

At the very end of 2025, I got Autechre's most recent live album, _AE\_2022–_. It's taken me the longest to get into their live albums. The sets tend to be a long, monolithic performance that slowly morphs from one idea to the next over the course of an hour or more. Both in my composition and listening, I tend to prefer short and succinct, but after experiencing such a set live, I have a greater appreciation for the duo's live work — it feels more familiar now, and takes me back to a good experience I had.

Another reason I hadn't gotten this particular album is that (at 19 tracks of around an hour each) it's usually fairly expensive. It turned out that at the end of December/beginning of January, the [Bleep listing of the album](https://bleep.com/release/483225-autechre-ae2022) was on sale for half price, and I ended up buying and enjoying it. It has me interested in re-listening to the Philadelphia set I attended, or hearing some other sets from their 2025 North America tour — would be cool if they release those.

### Kelley Sheehan

Kelley Sheehan is a composer whose work I've admired for a while. She pulls from a mix of underground noise music and contemporary classical performance practices, and her music has a wild riot of colors and strange sounds. I actually wrote about her composition “[Talk Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH3kxga4_JY)” for no-input mixer and percussion in my composition dissertation, along with a few other pieces that use audio equipment as instruments. I'd been wanting to have a release of hers I could buy from e.g., Bandcamp, so I was excited to see her release _new ears_ with the Hoodwink Duo.

### Meljoann

Meljoann describes their music as “hyperjack” — i.e., a hyperpop-like cousin of new jack swing. They released [_Status_](https://meljoann.com/posts/status/) early this year, and I've been enjoying it a lot. “Translate Me” has a thick, detuned bass against floating synths and vocals, and a reggaeton-like beat. “Data Ghost” has trap hi-hats, a funky synth bassline, and an 80s power pop-like guitar solo in the middle. It's all very fun and danceable, with a healthy dose of chaos and genre-bending. Note that in addition to more well-known platforms, including Bandcamp, you can buy this album directly from the artist, via their [Faircamp page](https://faircamp.meljoann.com/status/)! [^2]

## Regular Rotation

While I did listen to some new music this year, most of my listening has been familiar, comfortable things. Some of those tracks:

### Autechre

- “Dropp”
- “VL AL 5”
- “Tapr”
- “Gantz Graf”
- “qplay”
- “Altibzz”
- “V-Proc”
- “plyPhon”
- “Fol3”

### Fire-Toolz

- “Soaked: Another Name for Everything”
- “✓ iNTERBEiNG”
- “Experience ☆ Slips ☆ Away”
- “Screamography”
- “Second Life”
- “Response To Subdivisions ☾”
- “✓ BEiNG”
- “Clear Light”
- “觀音 Prayer For The Abuser (abridged)”

### William Fields

- “Doquado”

A fun note on this list is that my spouse and I used ”Altibzz” as background music in a video we showed at our wedding! My spouse told me they just wanted something that wasn't too cheesy, and I find this track to be hauntingly beautiful, and was happy with how it turned out.

## Revisited

### Subtle/13 & God

Subtle and 13 & God are both groups I loved in high school, and I've been listening to them again this year. Both groups are related: 13 & God is a collaboration between Doseone and Jel of Themselves and Subtle (and of other groups from the Anticon experimental hip-hop collective), and members of The Notwist. Both Subtle and 13 & God perform a mix of early 2000s alternative hip hop, trip hop, and indie rock, with rapper Doseone performing in a strange, dense style with dreamlike, abstract lyrics. I've been mostly listening to 13 & God's self-titled debut, and Subtle's _For Hero: For Fool_.

## Postscript

Thanks for reading! If you also listen to any of the artists on this list (or similar ones you think I might like) I would love to hear about it — I have comments, email, and a webmention field below. Until next time!
