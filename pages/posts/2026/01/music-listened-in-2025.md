Here's some of the music I've listened to in 2025 — things in regular rotation, things from a while ago that I've revisited, and new (or new-to-me) music I've discovered.

## New Listens

### Charli XCX

I've listened to Charli XCX since before _Vroom Vroom_ came out, but as is often the case with artists I like, I've been moving quite slowly through her discography. I hadn't given _Number 1 Angel_ a proper listen, but I currently have “Lipgloss” on repeat. I love the over-the-top, scratchy synth design, and I actually tried my hand at recreating the lead part, to some success. Looks like the key is something that has a bright, buzzy formant — I tried using a kick drum-based wavetable, and some oscillator sync.

### Fire-Toolz

Fire-Toolz' first album, _Interbeing_ came out in 2017. I first heard of her with 2018's _Skinless X-1_, and while I bought _Interbeing_ shortly after, I never really got into it until this year. This is common with me — Autechre, for example is pretty much my favorite group, but it took me a long time to get into albums other than _Confield_ and _Draft 7.30_. This year I found that I actually really like the first track on _Interbeing_, “Yellow Rose-Fire.”

### William Fields

I got to see William Fields live with Autechre in Philadelphia, and this next one is actually a live recording of that concert! It was very cool to see live, and I'm glad he decided to release the set. It's available [here](https://williamfields.bandcamp.com/album/opening-for-autechre-in-philadelphia) on Bandcamp.

### Kelley Sheehan

## Regular Rotation

While I did listen to some new music this year, most of my listening has been familiar, comfortable things. Some of those songs:

- Autechre
    - “Dropp”
    - “VL AL 5”
    - “Tapr”
    - “Gantz Graf”
    - “qplay”
    - “Altibzz”
    - “V-Proc”
    - “plyPhon”
    - “Fol3”
- Fire-Toolz
    - “Soaked: Another Name for Everything”
    - “✓ iNTERBEiNG”
    - “Experience ☆ Slips ☆ Away”
    - “Screamography”
    - “Second Life”
    - “Response To Subdivisions ☾”
    - “✓ BEiNG”
    - “Clear Light”
    - “觀音 Prayer For The Abuser (abridged)”

A fun note on this list is that my spouse and I used ”Altibzz” as background music in a video we showed at our wedding! My spouse told me they just wanted something that wasn't too cheesy, and I find this track to be hauntingly beautiful, and was happy with how it turned out.

## Revisited

Subtle and 13 & God are both groups I loved in high school, and I've been listening to them again this year. Both groups are related: 13 & God is a collaboration between members Doseone and Jel of Subtle (among other groups), and The Notwist. Both groups perform a mix of early 2000s alternative hip hop, trip hop, and indie rock, with rapper Doseone performing in a strange, dense style with dreamlike, abstract lyrics.
