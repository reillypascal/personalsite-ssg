<p>I'm currently working on a piece for (tentatively) B-flat clarinet; MIDI keyboard/Max; and a percussionist playing a mix of standard instruments, "junk," and feedback setups.</p>
<p>One of the sound design techniques I've been enjoying lately is making a "spectral composite" of two sounds using Eric Lyon's "<a href="https://github.com/ericlyon/FFTease3.0-MaxMSP">FFTease</a>" Max/MSP package. I'm using the <code>fftz.ether~</code> object, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes the FFT of two sounds</li>
<li>Compares the corresponding bin between the two FFTs</li>
<li>Takes either the louder or quieter of the two, depending on the settings</li>
<li>The choice can also be "weighted" toward one source or the other</li>
</ul>

<p>I particularly like the effect of taking the quieter of the two. It's great for combining a more sustained sound and one with a percussive envelope. As the percussive sound decays, more and more of its bins "win out," imparting a percussive envelope on the output.</p>

<h3>Sound 1: tonal/sustained</h3>
<p>For today's sound, my sustained, tonal source was made with the open-source <a href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io">Surge XT</a> synthesizer. Surge XT contains an oscillator titled "Twist" that appears to be an implementation of Mutable Instruments' "<a href="https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/modules/plaits/">Plaits</a>" Eurorack module. I'm using one of the organ-like wavetables to create a sound that rapidly morphs between low and high harmonics. Additionally, Surge XT supports microtuning, and I'm using the 131313... mode of <a href="https://en.xen.wiki/w/20edo">20-edo</a>.</p>

<p>I then used a trick I've discovered to make samples sound like they're played through an untuned FM radio. I have a collection of samples of just raw radio static. If I use those samples to modulate a delay on my source, the static convincingly changes in amplitude along with the sample.</p>

<p>In addition to sounding cool, the static gives the next stage something to "chew on." I used the phase vocoder from <a href="https://cycling74.com/tutorials/the-phase-vocoder-–-part-i">Cycling '74's</a> tutorial to time stretch my staticky chords, and the static causes all kinds of nice artifacts in the phase vocoder. After this, I added a little bit of saturation because having <code>fftz.ether~</code> pick the quieter bin can sometimes sound a bit dull.</p>

<h3>Sound 2: noisy/rhythmic</h3>
<p>On the other side, I started with a sine wave oscillator in gen~ frequency-modulating itself at a single-sample delay (it was this short delay that made me need to use gen~). I used the rand~ object to modulate a number of parameters, including the starting frequency and modulation depth. This produces some nice staticky, rhythmic noises that sound like a very light synthetic snare.</p>
<p>I then used Logic Pro's "flex time" feature to quantize the result to a 16th note grid (which also adds some nice time stretching artifacts!) </p>

<p>I play two copies (one for left and one for right) of the sample with random modulation of the speed and direction.</p>

<h3>Sound 1 & 2 combined</h3>
<p>Finally, when I put both the sustained and percussive sources into <code>fftz.ether~</code> the end result sounds like this:</p>

<p>I was going for something to fill out and add activity to the upper register, and I'm very happy with how it turned out.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I want to give a shout out to <a href="https://nathan.ho.name/archive.html">Nathan Ho</a>. I appreciate his blogging about making sounds in SuperCollider, and it's inspired me to do write-ups of my own sound design. </p>
<p>Today's sounds will be combined with the chord synthesizer I mentioned on Mastodon <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal/111773037885275169">last month</a>. All of this is played by the keyboardist, with today's sound (and variants of it using different chords) each being assigned to a single MIDI note. Ideally I would like to be composing more quickly, but I'm teaching a class I've never taught before (Intro to Music Business), in addition to other teaching, so that's been taking up a lot of my time.</p>
<p>If you'd like to try this for yourself, <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/cLVzHCBZ#SVlAyRb0RPL7sUwnXfke8A">here's</a> a link to the patches and other materials. You'll need the FFTease package and Max 8.</p>
