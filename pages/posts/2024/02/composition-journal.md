I\'m currently working on a piece for (tentatively) B-flat clarinet; MIDI keyboard/Max; and a percussionist playing a mix of standard instruments, \"junk,\" and feedback setups.

One of the sound design techniques I\'ve been enjoying lately is making a \"spectral composite\" of two sounds using Eric Lyon\'s \"[FFTease](https://github.com/ericlyon/FFTease3.0-MaxMSP)\" Max/MSP package. I\'m using the `fftz.ether~` object, which:

-   Takes the FFT of two sounds
-   Compares the corresponding bin between the two FFTs
-   Takes either the louder or quieter of the two, depending on the settings
-   The choice can also be \"weighted\" toward one source or the other

I particularly like the effect of taking the quieter of the two. It\'s great for combining a more sustained sound and one with a percussive envelope. As the percussive sound decays, more and more of its bins \"win out,\" imparting a percussive envelope on the output.

### Sound 1: tonal/sustained

For today\'s sound, my sustained, tonal source was made with the open-source [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io) synthesizer. Surge XT contains an oscillator titled \"Twist\" that appears to be an implementation of Mutable Instruments\' \"[Plaits](https://pichenettes.github.io/mutable-instruments-documentation/modules/plaits/)\" Eurorack module. I\'m using one of the organ-like wavetables to create a sound that rapidly morphs between low and high harmonics. Additionally, Surge XT supports microtuning, and I\'m using the 131313\... mode of [20-edo](https://en.xen.wiki/w/20edo).

I then used a trick I\'ve discovered to make samples sound like they\'re played through an untuned FM radio. I have a collection of samples of just raw radio static. If I use those samples to modulate a delay on my source, the static convincingly changes in amplitude along with the sample.

In addition to sounding cool, the static gives the next stage something to \"chew on.\" I used the phase vocoder from [Cycling \'74\'s](https://cycling74.com/tutorials/the-phase-vocoder-â€“-part-i) tutorial to time stretch my staticky chords, and the static causes all kinds of nice artifacts in the phase vocoder. After this, I added a little bit of saturation because having `fftz.ether~` pick the quieter bin can sometimes sound a bit dull.

### Sound 2: noisy/rhythmic

On the other side, I started with a sine wave oscillator in gen\~ frequency-modulating itself at a single-sample delay (it was this short delay that made me need to use gen\~). I used the rand\~ object to modulate a number of parameters, including the starting frequency and modulation depth. This produces some nice staticky, rhythmic noises that sound like a very light synthetic snare.

I then used Logic Pro\'s \"flex time\" feature to quantize the result to a 16th note grid (which also adds some nice time stretching artifacts!)

I play two copies (one for left and one for right) of the sample with random modulation of the speed and direction.

### Sound 1 & 2 combined

Finally, when I put both the sustained and percussive sources into `fftz.ether~` the end result sounds like this:

I was going for something to fill out and add activity to the upper register, and I\'m very happy with how it turned out.

### Conclusion

I want to give a shout out to [Nathan Ho](https://nathan.ho.name/archive.html). I appreciate his blogging about making sounds in SuperCollider, and it\'s inspired me to do write-ups of my own sound design.

Today\'s sounds will be combined with the chord synthesizer I mentioned on Mastodon [last month](https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal/111773037885275169). All of this is played by the keyboardist, with today\'s sound (and variants of it using different chords) each being assigned to a single MIDI note. Ideally I would like to be composing more quickly, but I\'m teaching a class I\'ve never taught before (Intro to Music Business), in addition to other teaching, so that\'s been taking up a lot of my time.

If you\'d like to try this for yourself, [here\'s](https://mega.nz/folder/cLVzHCBZ#SVlAyRb0RPL7sUwnXfke8A) a link to the patches and other materials. You\'ll need the FFTease package and Max 8.
