Welcome to my blog! I recently listened to [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/)'s talk "[This Talk Is Under Construction: A Love Letter to the Personal Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2Ux0hGQcs4)," as well as [this blog post](https://localghost.dev/blog/remembering-the-early-00s-teen-website-scene/) about the early-aughts teen website scene, and was immediately inspired to do more to make this site into a piece of personal expression. One of the ways I'm doing that is starting this blog, which I'll be using as a free-form journal about my interests and for write-ups of current projects. Some interests include:
- Digital signal processing and audio plugin development in C++
- Composition in Max/MSP/gen
- Homemade electronics, often with a musical bent
- Various projects on my Raspberry Pi, including the [gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net/) protocol, networking, and more
- The [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and "[smol web](https://smolweb.org/index.html)" or "small web"

RSS will likely be coming if I'm able to figure that out, as well as potentially a built-in comments feature. For now, I'll be posting updates to my [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal) (and if you know me personally, on other personal social media!).

I hope you'll join me!
