Hi everyone! Today's post is on [Max/MSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)) sound design. I'll be talking about how I got [this sound](https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal/112242684024114281) I posted about on my [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@reillypascal) a few weeks ago. It's part of a trio I'm writing for MIDI keyboard, clarinet, and percussion tentatively titled *Forget your name*.

I mentioned in my [Feb. 27 post](https://reillyspitzfaden.com/blog/02-27-2024) that I've been using the [`fftz.ether~`](https://github.com/ericlyon/FFTease3.0-MaxMSP) Max/MSP object to combine the spectra of two sounds. It compares each FFT bin between the two sounds, and selects the one that's either quieter or louder, depending on the settings. Here I'm using it to combine glitching lofi piano/percussion with various radio sounds.

Since I'm busy finishing up my semester of teaching, I'll be splitting this between two or so posts. Today, let's look at how I made the looping piano snippets. You can download the patch [here](https://mega.nz/folder/ge9wVAqT#3PeZp-8-t6B7plrMvAICJg).

### Making the Piano Snippets

To start, I combined some lofi piano, bell, and percussion sounds, and used iZotope's [Vinyl](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/vinyl.html) plugin to add a **large** amount of record noise. The source samples are by [holizna](https://freesound.org/people/holizna/) on freesound.org, and he kindly released them under a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license. I used Logic Pro to split the audio at the [transients](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/logicpro/lgcp21586c87/mac) (select a region; ctrl + cmd + shift + S). I then exported all of the resulting snips as individual audio files. Here is the audio before chopping at the transients:

</audio>

### Loading the Snippets into a [`polybuffer~`](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/polybuffer~) in Max/MSP

The `polybuffer~` object can load multiple sound files into a collection of buffers that it manages, which can be independently accessed and assigned to a `groove~` object for playback. I send the `polybuffer~` the message "readfolder" followed by the absolute path to the subfolder in which I store the audio snippets. You can get the absolute path to the parent patch by sending `thispatcher` a "path" message, and then use `combine` to add the path for the subfolders.

After instructing `polybuffer~` to load the files, I send it the message "getbufferlist", which causes it to output the word "bufferlist", the buffers one-by-one, and then the message "bufferlist done". If I filter out the words "bufferlist" and "done" using `zl.filter`, I can collect the buffers into a single list with `zl.group`. I can listen for the word "done" using a `sel` object (placed "upstream" of the `zl.filter`s), and send a bang to `zl.group` to output the finished list. Prepending "store 0" before the list of buffers stores the list in a `coll` object (essentially a lookup table) at the index 0 for the next step. I repeat this whole process to add snippets of record clicks and pops to the same `coll` at index 1. The patch so far is shown below:

    alt="Max/MSP patch described by the previous two paragraphs, with two polybuffer~ objects being loaded with samples from folders, and the lists of buffers from the polybuffer~s being loaded into a coll named cylinder_samp." 
    id="polybuffer_loader_img"/>

### Looping and Mangling the Snippets

By naming the `coll` objects in the `sample_chooser` subpatcher the same as the one from the previous step, I'm able to access this list of buffers in the playback section of the patch. First I dump the entire list of buffers and use `zl.len` (gets length of a list) to get the number of sub-buffers. I can then use this length to set the size for an `urn` object (random without repeats), and use the random numbers from the `urn` along with the "nth" message to select buffers at the appropriate index from the `coll`. Note that you will have to add one to the random values from `urn` because the "nth" method starts at one instead of zero — this fact regularly trips me up. The `vinyl_pops_chooser` subpatcher does the same thing with the list of samples at index 1 in the `coll`. The contents of this subpatcher are shown below:

<img src="/media/blog/2024/05/coll_random_select.webp" 
    alt="Max/MSP patch described by the previous paragraph, with a coll object named cylinder_samp as before, and logic to get the length at index 0; generate random numbers without repeats up to that length; and retrieve the buffer name at index 0, and a random point into the list of buffers." 
    id="coll_random_select_img"/>

I have a metronome object plus a random number generator sending out a clock pulse that varies in rate with each pulse. I use that with a chain of counters to periodically load new buffers from the `polybuffer~` into `groove~` for playback. Throughout the patch I have subpatchers labeled `%_gate` — these are "Bernoulli gates." When a message or bang enters the gate, the subpatcher makes a random number between 0–100; checks if that value is less than or equal to a threshold; and if so, allows the message/bang through. The `patcherargs` object in these subpatchers gets the number typed after the patcher name and uses this as a threshold/probability for the gate. See below:

<img src="/media/blog/2024/05/metro_counter_logic.webp" 
    alt="The metronome, on/off toggle, and counter logic from the patch."/>

I randomly set the playback length either equal to the snippet, or equal to a subsection of the snippet, and if it's a subsection, I set the `groove~` object to loop. I get the length of a snippet by using the `info~` object and setting that to reference the appropriate buffer. A nice result of choosing random subsections to loop is that sometimes these sections are extremely short, and looping them produces a high-pitched, glitchy tone that pops out of the texture.

I have the groove object set to time stretching mode, and based on a probability I set, I play the snippet back either slowly or at normal rate. I also randomly shift the [formant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant) up or down within a small selected range. See below:

<img src="/media/blog/2024/05/sample_chooser_groove.webp"
    alt="The speed, looping, sample chooser, formant modulation, and pitch-shift logic, all going into a groove~ object."
    />

Finally, I have another `polybuffer~` loaded with short vinyl scrapes and pops, and using a similar setup to the piano snippets, I periodically play one of those back. All together, the mangling sounds like this:

### Conclusion

That's all for today! I'm finishing up my semester of teaching, and you can expect a part two for this soon. Please feel free to download [this patch](https://mega.nz/folder/ge9wVAqT#3PeZp-8-t6B7plrMvAICJg) and play around with it in the meantime. I'm also interested in feedback on this post. My aim is for it to be a good amount of explanation for a relatively broad audience — not so deep that it loses people, but not leaving out necessary detail. If you could comment letting me know how you found it, that would be appreciated!
