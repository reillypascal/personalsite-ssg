### What I've been listening to

- [*Collapse Etiquette*](https://patrickcarey.bandcamp.com/album/collapse-etiquette), by Patrick Carey
    - Both aggressive/noisy and ambient. There are bright additive and saw synths, and a bunch of intense, percussive, glitchy noise. It reminds me of tuning a radio through a "new age" station with poor reception, and I found it very inspiring for my own work.
- "[Cycles](https://alexanderpanos.bandcamp.com/track/cycles-2)" by Alexander Panos
    - I first discovered him via his "[Color Transfer](https://payhip.com/b/h9l7V)" Max for Live bundle, which makes some very cool sounds. This track is heavy on the granular sounds and "mulched-up" drums, but it also has some very poppy and traditionally "pretty" chords and vocals. Very beautiful and unique.

### What I've been reading

- Nathan Ho's [blog post](https://nathan.ho.name/posts/cepstrum/) on creative uses of [cepstral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepstrum) processing.
    - I've been interested in doing this in my own sound design, but FFT processing in Max is one area I need more work. Nathan uses SuperCollider, and while I like what it can do, I prefer to write for other people to perform, so I like Max's ability to make robust GUIs for my performers.
- Tom Coates' [post](http://plasticbag.org/archives/2024/01/how-threads-will-integrate-with-the-fediverse/) on how Threads will integrate with the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).
    - I'm intensely torn on Threads, Bluesky, potential Tumblr [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) support, etc. I love the Fediverse; I would like to interact with as many of my friends as possible on it; and Cory Doctorow's [*The Internet Con*](https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con) has gotten me excited about interoperability, so on one hand, I would like as many things as possible to connect to the Fediverse. On the other hand, part of what makes the Fediverse great is the non-commercial nature, and I don't want Meta to ["Embrace, Extend, Extinguish"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) it.
