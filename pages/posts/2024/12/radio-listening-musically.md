In around 2019 I stumbled across the [Wide-band WebSDR](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/) ^[ A [software-defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) (SDR) system often looks like a simple radio receiver and analog-to-digital converter connecting to a computer, with the tuning, filtering, demodulation, and most other features handled by software. ] at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. I was hooked. The cold, alien tones of the many data signals ([clock synchronization](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/DCF77), [pagers](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/POCSAG), [modems](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/STANAG_4285), and more) were unlike anything I'd heard before. Many voice signals sound otherworldly as well — shrouded in noise, filtered to a narrow band, and often automated to read data such as [weather information for pilots](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Single_Sideband_Voice#Hear_RAF_Volmet_.28USB_Voice.29_Live_at_WebSDR_Univ._of_Twente_.28Alternate_Frequency.29). 

There's also the awareness that the sounds I'm hearing are at a vast distance, both from me to the receiver in the Netherlands, and often from the receiver to the signals it receives. In the [shortwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_radio) bands (~3–30 MHz), "[skywave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave)" or "skip" propagation occurs. Radio waves at those frequencies bounce off the ionosphere, traveling much further than the distance to the horizon. Using my own receiver ^[ For the curious, I used an [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/) USB dongle and a Nooelec "[Balun](https://www.nooelec.com/store/balun-one-nine.html)" to [match the antenna and receiver impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impedance_matching), with two long pieces of wire for the antenna. ] which I acquired in early 2020, I once heard a station in Japan from my home in upstate New York. When I listen, I feel deeply aware of the vast gulf between me and the signal, and in the interference the sound has gathered on its way to me, this gulf is present in a very tangible way.

When listening, I still struggle to fully encapsulate the emotive response to the sounds, but from the beginning I knew I had to connect this to my composition somehow.

### The "Sonic Spectre" — Allowing Our Media to Haunt Us
Around the same time I discovered the Twente WebSDR, I read Kristen Gallerneaux' book "[High Static, Dead Lines](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9781907222665/high-static-dead-lines/)," which was equally as impactful. As she weaves together spurious radio signals during a [1934 high altitude balloon test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannette_Piccard#Flight); the [Max Headroom signal hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_signal_hijacking); and the eerie voices of the [Votrax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax) speech synthesizer, Gallerneaux calls on us to “allow our media to haunt us," and finds these moments of haunting to be “crucial to understanding” sonic media.

As an example of this haunting, she gives the anecdote of being awake at night as a child, roaming the house alone, and trying out a 45 RPM record she had discovered, accidentally playing it back at 33 1/3 RPM. The resulting sound was "demonic" and terrifying on its own, and coupled with her young age, solitude, the late hour, and the element of surprise, this moment became a much deeper experience than a simple playback error might seem.

As I scan through the shortwave bands, I notice feelings of loneliness and the sense of being in a wide-open space as I ponder the vast distances involved. I feel as if I'm hearing something that wasn't meant for my ears. And the crackles, the rushing, ringing sound of the narrow filter on the sound, and the buzz of machines communicating sends a chill down my spine, much like I truly am being haunted.

### Telecommunications Sounds as Music

### Challenges

Since existing music poses copyright issues, and I usually want more flexibility, the remaining sounds are somewhat limited

Translating a vibe into music is an interesting challenge

### Previous ideas
- collaborative thinking about music tech
  - building associations and thinking musically
- use experience of walking around town looking at radio antennas?
- quick to feel a "vibe" and know I appreciate something; slow to put into words
