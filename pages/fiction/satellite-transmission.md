It was in the middle of a hot, long summer when I first heard the signals. At first, they simply buzzed and whistled as I turned the dials. Gradually I learned how to decode them. Usually each one required sifting through long-lost forum posts or satellite schematics, resurrecting software that had been almost completely forgotten to time. The software ticked along, incrementing through small bits of data — coordinates, beacons, and other unremarkable artifacts.

In that strange period between spring and fall semester, moving slowly through the murk of the humid air, I had simply wanted something to do to pass the time.

In a way, the transmissions reminded me of home — their great distance, their lonely calls.
