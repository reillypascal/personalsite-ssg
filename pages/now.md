<h2 class="sectionHeader">Current Activities</h2>

I've been wanting to learn how to write externals for Max/MSP in C for a while now, and I finally got around to learning how. I have [one started](https://github.com/reillypascal/rs.max), and it's turning out to be a lot of fun.

[Writing for the September 2025 IndieWeb Carnival](/posts/2025/09/september-indieweb-carnival/) got me excited about creative writing and fiction. I've added a [fiction page](/fiction) to my site. I've been reading some Borges and thinking about metafiction, and that's giving me some fun ideas I think I'd like to try.

Recently I've been getting into TTRPGs (i.e., games like D&D). I had been wanting to find more in-person friends and activities, so I joined a group playing Pathfinder 2e at my local library. The group has been welcoming, and the game is turning out to be a lot of fun.

I also just got married! My partner and I had a nice small ceremony in October with family and friends. I'm so excited to spend the rest of my life with them.

<!-- Recently I've found some new hobbies. First is photography. I tracked down an analog SLR camera (a Minolta X-370) that I had in high school but never used, and I'm learning analog photography with it. I also found some local classes on developing black & white film, and that should be a fun skill to learn. -->

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Listening</h2>

William Fields, [_Opening for Autechre in Philadelphia_](https://williamfields.bandcamp.com/album/opening-for-autechre-in-philadelphia): I went to Autechre's concert in Philadelphia, so I got to see this set live! I was hoping it would be released, and I'm glad it was.

Fire-Toolz, [_Private Angel Message_](https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/album/private-angel-message): I love how this one includes a metal cover of a Trammell Starks song that originally ran on The Weather Channel!

tsone, [_A ghost and a guest_](https://evel.bandcamp.com/album/a-ghost-and-a-guest): This one is for fans of Autechre and Richard Devine. tsone uses Max/MSP to make a mix of ambient synths and dense, rhythmically complex glitchy percussion.

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Reading</h2>

_A Game in Yellow_ by Hailey Piper: a thrill-seeking couple — Carmen and Blanca — finds a strange play, _The King in Yellow_. If someone reads it for just a moment, they will have a rush of survivor's euphoria, but if read for too long, it will drive the reader mad. Carmen becomes more and more obsessed with spending time in the play's world, and the play's world begins to filter into the real one.

_S._ by Doug Dorst: presented as a library copy of _Ship of Theseus_ by fictional author V.M. Straka, with handwritten notes in the margins between two college students. V.M. Straka is reclusive and mysterious, and conspiracy theories surround him, and the students' relationship grows as they dig deeper into this.

<!-- _The Extinction of Irena Rey_ by Jennifer Croft: A novel about a group of translators working in a mysterious forest to translate a novel. Filled with footnotes, deeply meta, and the forest is full of strange fungi. -->

<!-- _Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges: I've heard people mention the story “The Garden of Forking Paths” in connection with hypertext, and I'm very intrigued to see more. -->
