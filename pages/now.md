<h2 class="sectionHeader">Current Activities</h2>

I've been continuing to work on my [data2audio](https://github.com/reillypascal/data2audio) Rust tool for converting batches of files into audio. I figured out how to use `rayon` to process multiple files in parallel, and now it's super fast — I got all ~12.5 GB (\> 35,000 files!) of data from the Xcode macOS app converted in ~17 seconds!

I'm also getting married! My partner and I are engaged, and having a nice small ceremony in October. I'm so excited to spend the rest of my life with them.

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Listening</h2>

Fire-Toolz, [_Private Angel Message_](https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/album/private-angel-message): I love how this one includes a metal cover of a Trammell Starks song that originally ran on The Weather Channel!

tsone, [_A ghost and a guest_](https://evel.bandcamp.com/album/a-ghost-and-a-guest): This one is for fans of Autechre and Richard Devine. tsone uses Max/MSP to make a mix of ambient synths and dense, rhythmically complex glitchy percussion.

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Reading</h2>

_Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges: I've heard people mention the story “The Garden of Forking Paths” in connection with hypertext, and I'm very intrigued to see more.

_The Extinction of Irena Rey_ by Jennifer Croft: A novel about a group of translators working in a mysterious forest to translate a novel. Filled with footnotes, deeply meta, and the forest is full of strange fungi.
