<!-- I've been continuing to work on my [data2audio](https://github.com/reillypascal/data2audio) Rust tool for converting batches of files into audio. I figured out how to use `rayon` to process multiple files in parallel, and now it's super fast — I got all ~12.5 GB (\> 35,000 files!) of data from the Xcode macOS app converted in ~17 seconds! This has made a big difference for composing. Now I can make and audition a huge number of databending samples without it being nearly as much of a slog. -->

While I originally planned to use this blog for technical writing, [my entry for the September 2025 IndieWeb Carnival](/posts/2025/09/september-indieweb-carnival/) got me excited about creative writing and fiction. I've added a [fiction page](/fiction) to my site, and I have a second creative writing piece that's going there/on my blog soon.

Recently I've found some new hobbies. First is photography. I tracked down an analog SLR camera (a Minolta X-370) that I had in high school but never used, and I'm learning analog photography with it. I also found some local classes on developing black & white film, and that should be a fun skill to learn.

Next is TTRPGS (i.e., games like D&D). I had been wanting to find more in-person friends and activities, so I joined a group playing Pathfinder 2e at my local library. The group has been welcoming, and the game is turning out to be a lot of fun.

I also just got married! My partner and I had a nice small ceremony in October with family and friends. I'm so excited to spend the rest of my life with them.

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Listening</h2>

Fire-Toolz, [_Private Angel Message_](https://fire-toolz.bandcamp.com/album/private-angel-message): I love how this one includes a metal cover of a Trammell Starks song that originally ran on The Weather Channel!

tsone, [_A ghost and a guest_](https://evel.bandcamp.com/album/a-ghost-and-a-guest): This one is for fans of Autechre and Richard Devine. tsone uses Max/MSP to make a mix of ambient synths and dense, rhythmically complex glitchy percussion.

<h2 class="sectionHeader">Currently Reading</h2>

_The Extinction of Irena Rey_ by Jennifer Croft: A novel about a group of translators working in a mysterious forest to translate a novel. Filled with footnotes, deeply meta, and the forest is full of strange fungi.

_S._ by Doug Dorst: presented as a library copy of _Ship of Theseus_ by fictional author V.M. Straka, with handwritten notes in the margins between two college students. V.M. Straka is reclusive and mysterious, and conspiracy theories surround him, and the students' relationship grows as they dig deeper into this.

_Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges: I've heard people mention the story “The Garden of Forking Paths” in connection with hypertext, and I'm very intrigued to see more.
