<h1 class="sectionHeader">What Is RSS?</h1>

[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is the classic way of following a blog or other feed, it's the technology behind podcasts, and it's my favorite way to follow things. An RSS feed is just a simple text file that contains a list of posts, including the post title, author, content, etc. When you open the link to this file in an [RSS reader program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator), you can view all this information and read the posts conveniently and cleanly, and keep track of as many blogs, news sites, etc. as you want. I find it's [a nice way to see only the things you want](/posts/2024/03/rss-is-nice/) and avoid the algorithms of many social media sites.

For desktop RSS readers, I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) on macOS, [Newsflash](https://apps.gnome.org/NewsFlash/) on Linux, and I've heard good things about [yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr/releases) on Windows. For mobile, I use [Capy Reader](https://capyreader.com/) on Android, and I've previously enjoyed [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) on iOS.
