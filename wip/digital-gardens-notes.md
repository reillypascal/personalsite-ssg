## Outline
### Gardens vs Streams
- Chris Cerrone notation discussion x
  - also see FOSS development on Discord, Matrix, etc. x
  - I want permanence of forums, wikis; build knowledge over time
- explain Hapgood article, why significant to me x
  - I want interconnectedness; further helps to build knowledge base
- still room for status updates, greetings, jokes, but the parts where discussion happens would be nicer if they were closer to a wiki
- Facebook didn't used to have a feed
### Talking about Music Technology
- collaborative thinking about music tech
  - building associations and thinking musically
  - the why, not just the how
    - music tech pedagogy; what I wish were different
  - use dissertation metaphor discussion?
  - use experience of walking around town looking at radio antennas?
  - quick to feel a "vibe" and know I appreciate something; slow to put into words
### The Garden as Socialization
- instead of socializing in the stream, socializing in the garden
  - reference sharing Memex entries
  - practicing with Obsidian, but it's hard to make deeply, meaningfully interlinked texts
### My Particular Niche
- difficulty of finding other people in my field in this particular scene

  > It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together to form a new book. It is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails.

> But that's the thing: I don't think dansup, Eugene and friends are trying to create a "truly post-Facebook" social media platform; I was wrong for thinking so. It's a lot more obvious to me now that they're reformers.

- [Against the dark forest](https://www.wrecka.ge/against-the-dark-forest/)
> The assumption that "Twitter but decentralized" or "Facebook but open-source and federated" will necessarily be good—rather than differently bad—is a weak one. 
> I think our failure to remember that the mega-platforms are just intentionally extractive constructs run by brainmelted but very human weirdos is a failure of accountability, but our failure to remember that it doesn’t have to be this way is a failure not only of imagination, but of nerve.

Until I heard Vox's [Land of the Giants](https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/land-of-the-giants) podcast discuss the introduction of the Facebook news feed, I hadn't thought too much about how the platform looked when it started. I signed up for it in 2012 in my second year of college, so the news feed is how it's always looked for me.
