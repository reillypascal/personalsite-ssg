title: Digital Gardens, Music Tech, and Collaboration as Socialization
description: What if socializing on the Internet were more like editing Wikipedia? Also I discuss some of the ways I want to write and talk about music technology.

A few days ago I was part of a Facebook thread about music notation. Composer Christopher Cerrone posted asking what way of notating a complex rhythm would be most readable. The general consensus was something akin to what Thomas Ad√©s does in e.g., ["Lieux Retrouves," movement 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DOoCEF1c2Q&t=300s) in the piano part: notate it two different ways, with one shown above the other to clarify how the instruments align.

Within the thread, there were a number of interesting finer points raised, but as I watched the discussion continue, I was a bit sad to think that it would all disappear in the stream of future posts, and that even if the discussion were somehow pinned, it would not be easily accessible from a search engine.

I have seen a number of people express similar sentiments about the free and open-source software world. Services like Discord are popular (and admittedly easy) ways to discuss the development process. However, there are two big issues: 1) the discussion is not easily searchable from the rest of the Internet, and 2) the linear nature of a chat means that the same questions are raised again and again. Overall, closed platforms with linear forms of discussion are not conducive to building lasting knowledge that is easy to return to or discover.

### Gardens vs Streams
## Outline
### Gardens vs Streams
- Chris Cerrone notation discussion
  - also see FOSS development on Discord, Matrix, etc.
  - I want permanence of forums, wikis; build knowledge over time
- explain Hapgood article, why significant to me
  - I want interconnectedness; further helps to build knowledge base
- still room for status updates, greetings, jokes, but the parts where discussion happens would be nicer if they were closer to a wiki
### Talking about Music Technology
- collaborative thinking about music tech
  - building associations and thinking musically
  - the why, not just the how
    - music tech pedagogy; what I wish were different
  - use dissertation metaphor discussion?
  - use experience of walking around town looking at radio antennas?
  - quick to feel a "vibe" and know I appreciate something; slow to put into words
### The Garden as Socialization
- instead of socializing in the stream, socializing in the garden
  - reference sharing Memex entries
  - practicing with Obsidian, but it's hard to make deeply, meaningfully interlinked texts
### My Particular Niche
- difficulty of finding other people in my field in this particular scene
