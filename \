Continuing from [a previous post](/posts/2025/06/reverb-part-1), today we'll be looking at another collection of reverb algorithms that I've implemented in my [reverb plugin](https://github.com/reillypascal/RSAlgorithmicVerb/releases). With only a small increase in complexity over last time, we can get a reverb that grows in density over its duration, much as a real room would, and that sounds smoother and less metallic.

There are two key differences between the designs here and [the Schroeder reverb I discussed previously](/posts/2025/06/reverb-part-1/#the-classic-schroeder-reverberator): 1) in this design we will “nest” an allpass filter within another allpass filter, causing the echo density to grow over time, and 2) we will connects the ends of a chain of allpasses into one large “ring,” smoothing out the sound. Let's discuss how this all works!

## Nested Allpass Filters

As we [previously discussed](/posts/2025/06/reverb-part-1/#allpass-filters), an allpass filter is created by a feedforward and feedback delay in series, with the gain of one of them being negative. This lets all frequencies through at equal amplitude, but delays different frequencies by different amounts, “smearing” or “blurring” the rhythmic attacks of an incoming sound, which is excellent for simulating reverberation.

Schroeder found that the “smearing” from allpass filters multiplies the number of echoes about threefold. However, the number of echoes is roughly constant over the duration of the reverberation. In a real room, echoes continually build up over the course of a reverb tail. To achieve this buildup, Barry Vercoe and Miller Puckette propose replacing the delay in an allpass filter with another allpass filter. [^1] Since (as Schroeder describes) an allpass filter will multiply the echoes that pass through it, taking the output of the inner allpass and feeding it back to the input will cause that multiplication to compound, increasing the number of echoes over time.

<!-- Gardner notes that real rooms give an “exponential buildup” of echoes over time, and to mimic this, he replaces the delay inside an allpass filter with another allpass filter, creating a nested structure. He confirms that this will not spoil the flat frequency response, finding that if the inner delay unit is allpass, the entire configuration is also allpass. With this out of the way, he then notes that

> The echoes generated by the inner allpass filters will be recirculated to their inputs via the outer feedback path. Thus, the number of echoes generated in response to an impulse will increase over time rather than remaining constant as with a standard allpass filter. [^2] -->

### Implementing Nested Allpasses

Take all allpass filters from different “taps” in a single delay line

## Allpass Rings

Rather than a single straight chain of single and nested allpasses, Gardner finds that taking the end of that chain and feeding it back into the input of the entire chain produces better-sounding results. He comments that

<!-- > The harshness, buzziness, and metallic sound of the allpass system is smoothed out, possibly as a result of the increase in echo density caused by the outermost feedback path. [^3] -->

Last time, we placed a low-pass filter in the feedback path of individual comb filters. This time, Gardner suggests placing a single low-pass filter in the feedback path for the entire chain. In both contexts, the purpose is to cause higher frequencies to decay faster, similar to the effect of the atmosphere in a real room.

Gardner suggests taking the output sound from multiple points along the allpass chain. These must be _between_ allpass filters, rather than inside an allpass — Gardner demonstrates that taking it from inside an allpass will transform the allpass into a comb, producing an undesirable metallic quality. The output signals can be scaled in different proportions to customize the decay profile of the reverb, and the gain in the global feedback path can be used to scale the decay time overall.

Below are the three designs Gardner gives. The small one is good for decay times between 0.38–0.57 seconds; the medium for 0.58–1.29 seconds; and the large for 1.30 seconds and above. Gardner does not find any particular rule for choosing decay times, noting that the process for designing the three topologies he describes next was “purely empirical.” [^4] As with designing Schroeder reverbs, a good starting point seems to be to avoid delay times that easily divide into each other; this ensures the delays do not rhythmically align.
